0_san+francisco san+francisco As seen in the  quake, the    earthquake, and the  Tōhoku earthquake, subduction zone earthquakes can cause large tsunamis, and many coastal areas in the region have prepared tsunami evacuation plans in anticipation of a possible   earthquake.
1_san+francisco san+francisco However, the major nearby cities, notably , , , , and , which are located on inland waterways rather than on the coast, would be sheltered from the full brunt of a tsunami.
2_san+francisco san+francisco These cities do have many vulnerable structures, especially bridges and unreinforced brick buildings; consequently, most of the damage to the cities would probably be from the earthquake itself.
3_san+francisco san+francisco expert asserts that buildings in  are vastly inadequate even to withstand an earthquake of the size of the    earthquake, much less the much greater  that may well occur.
4_san+francisco san+francisco The quake ruptured a substantial portion of the southern  , but not the entire length.
5_san+francisco san+francisco , director of     , stated that  slip likely stopped in  area near  , perhaps because  tectonic stresses on that part of  fault had been released        earthquake.
6_san+francisco san+francisco The average slip along the fault was  meters ( feet), and a maximum offset of  meters ( feet) was recorded in the   area in southeastern    .
7_san+francisco san+francisco The amount of fault slip gives this earthquake a moment magnitude of , comparable to that of the    earthquake.

40_san+francisco san+francisco Over a period of  , the city had become the financial, trade and cultural center of the ; operated the busiest port on the  ; and was the "gateway to the ", through which growing  economic and military power was projected into the  and .
41_san+francisco san+francisco Over 80% of the city was destroyed by the earthquake and fire.
42_san+francisco san+francisco Though   would rebuild quickly,  disaster would divert trade, industry and population growth south to  , which during    would become  largest and most important urban area in  West.
43_san+francisco san+francisco In addition, many of the city's leading poets and writers retreated to  where, as "The Barness", they established the arts colony reputation that continues .
44_san+francisco san+francisco The   Report, a study  the  quake led and edited by Pressor    the   , showed that the very same  Andreas Fault which had caused the disaster in   ran close to   as well.
45_san+francisco san+francisco The earthquake was the  natural disaster of its magnitude to be documented by photography and motion picture footage.
46_san+francisco san+francisco Moreover, it occurred at a time when the science of seismology was blossoming.
47_san+francisco san+francisco The overall cost of the damage from the earthquake was estimated at the time to be around US$400 million ($8.2 billion in  dollars).
48_san+francisco san+francisco Although the impact of the earthquake on   was the most famous, the earthquake also inflicted considerable damage on several other cities.
49_san+francisco san+francisco These include   and ta , the entire downtown of which was essentially destroyed.

52_san+francisco san+francisco The shaking intensity as described on the   intensity scale reached  in   and up to  in areas to the north like ta  where destruction was devastating.
53_san+francisco san+francisco There were  of minor earthquakes – more than at any other time in the historical record for northern  – before the  quake.
54_san+francisco san+francisco Widely interpreted  as precursory activity to   earthquake, y have been found to have a strong seasonal pattern and have been postulated to be due to large seasonal sediment loads in coastal bays that overlie faults as a result of  erosion caused by "hydraulic mining" in    of   Gold Rush.
55_san+francisco san+francisco Due to a widespread practice by insurers to indemnify   properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, most of the destruction in the city was blamed on the fires.
56_san+francisco san+francisco Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties, in order to claim them on their insurance.
57_san+francisco san+francisco Capt.
58_san+francisco san+francisco of the     reported that he "was stopped by a fireman who told me that people in that neighborhood were firing their houses… they were told that they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire."
59_san+francisco san+francisco As water mains were also broken, the city fire department had few resources with which to fight the fires.
60_san+francisco san+francisco Several fires in the downtown area merged to become  giant inferno.
61_san+francisco san+francisco Brigadier General  , commander of the Presidio of   and a resident of  , tried to bring the fire under control by detonating blocks of buildings around the fire to create firebreaks with all sorts of means, ranging from black powder and dynamite to even artillery barrages.
62_san+francisco san+francisco Often the explosions set the ruins on fire or helped spread it.
63_san+francisco san+francisco Property losses from the disaster have been estimated to be more than $400 million.
64_san+francisco san+francisco An insurance industry source tallies insured losses at $235 million (equivalent to $ in  dollars).
65_san+francisco san+francisco Political and business leaders strongly downplayed the effects of the earthquake, fearing loss of outside investment in the city which was badly needed to rebuild.
66_san+francisco san+francisco In his  public statement,  governor    emphasized the need to rebuild quickly: "This is not the  time that   has been destroyed by fire, I have not the slightest doubt that the City by the   will be speedily rebuilt, and will, almost before we know it, resume her former great activity."
67_san+francisco san+francisco The earthquake itself is not even mentioned in the statement.
68_san+francisco san+francisco Fatality and monetary damage estimates were manipulated.
69_san+francisco san+francisco In the rush to rebuild the city, building stndrds were  mde much more stringent, but fter   yer, they were in fct relxed, insted of strengthened, "by upwrds of 50%" ccording to historin  Hnsen.
70_san+francisco san+francisco The History Channel International series "Mega Disasters" attributes the rollback of the strict codes to complaints by contractors under duress from city fathers for the slow rate of reconstruction.
71_san+francisco san+francisco In the report, the building codes were taken back off the books in only  , while the official death toll was placed at a mere —which estimates raised plenty of eyebrows even at the time, as it was undoubtedly the most photographed disaster then known to mankind, and the damage suggests far more would have been trapped as is backed by anecdotal stories of many being trapped in fallen buildings then consumed by flames.
72_san+francisco san+francisco For over   , research by a   librarian has amassed a death toll well in excess of  , and she has opined the effort will go on for  more.
73_san+francisco san+francisco Part of the rush to rebuild was the desire to be ready for the    set to be hosted in , and indeed by that  there was almost no visible damage to be seen in the city.
74_san+francisco san+francisco This general disregard for earthquake safety still has effects for  city , as a majority  buildings  standing in  city were built in        to  lax codes.
75_san+francisco san+francisco Building standards did not reach even  levels until  .
76_san+francisco san+francisco A detailed analysis of the city  estimates that an earthquake less powerful than the  quake would completely destroy many sections of the city and result in thousands of deaths.
77_san+francisco san+francisco At the time,  deaths were reported.
78_san+francisco san+francisco However, that figure was fabricated by government officials who felt that reporting the true death toll would hurt real estate prices and efforts to rebuild the city.
79_san+francisco san+francisco In addition, hundreds of casualties in  went ignored and unrecorded; that number is still uncertain , estimated to be roughly  at minimum.
80_san+francisco san+francisco Most of the deaths occurred in   itself, but  were reported elsewhere in the  ; nearby cities, such as ta  and   also suffered severe damages.
81_san+francisco san+francisco In  , the earthquake permanently shifted the course of the   near its mouth.

84_san+francisco san+francisco Devastating fires broke out in the city and lasted for  .
85_san+francisco san+francisco As a result of the quake and fires, about  people died and over 80% of   was destroyed.
86_san+francisco san+francisco For a number of , the epicenter of the quake was assumed to be near the town of , in the Point Reyes area of  , because of evidence of the degree of local earth displacement.
87_san+francisco san+francisco In  , a seismologist at UC  proposed that  epicenter was more likely offshore of  , to  northwest of  Golden Gate.
88_san+francisco san+francisco However, the most recent analysis by the     () shows that the most likely epicenter was very near   on the coast of  , an adjacent suburb just south of  .
89_san+francisco san+francisco An offshore epicenter is supported by the occurrence of a local tsunami recorded by a tidal gauge at the   ; the wave had an amplitude of approximately  in ( cm) and an approximate period of – .
90_san+francisco san+francisco The earthquake was the worst single incident for the insurance industry before the    attacks and the largest  relief effort ever to   including even Hurricane Katrina.
91_san+francisco san+francisco After the  earthquake, a global discussion arose concerning a legally flawless exclusion of the earthquake hazard from fire insurance contracts.
92_san+francisco san+francisco It was pressed ahead mainly by re-insurers.
93_san+francisco san+francisco Their aim was the globally uniform solution of the problem of earthquake hazard in fire insurance contracts.
94_san+francisco san+francisco Until , a few countries, especially in , followed the call for an exclusion of the earthquake hazard from all fire insurance contracts.
95_san+francisco san+francisco In the , however, the question was discussed differently.
96_san+francisco san+francisco But the traumatized public reacted with fierce opposition.
97_san+francisco san+francisco On   909 the   enacted the        which did not contain any earthquake clause.
98_san+francisco san+francisco Thus the state decided that insurers would have to pay again if another earthquake was followed by fires.
99_san+francisco san+francisco Other earthquake-endangered countries followed the  example.
100_san+francisco san+francisco The insurance payments heavily affected the international financial system.
101_san+francisco san+francisco Gold transfers from  insurance companies to policyholders in   led to a rise in interest rates, subsequently to a lack of available loans and finally to the    crisis of   which led to the Panic of .

106_san+francisco san+francisco There's going to be damage and some perhaps major.
107_san+francisco san+francisco If  occurred in the z close to , it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes.
108_san+francisco san+francisco Places like   are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them."
109_san+francisco san+francisco In his definition, the state's earthquakes are "insignificant".
110_san+francisco san+francisco Emergency planner   is skeptical of a major earthquake, stating that "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here.
111_san+francisco san+francisco It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the  scale.
112_san+francisco san+francisco You could have a No.  (magnitude) earthquake in  and not damage anything, but the same type in   could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes."
113_san+francisco san+francisco Although the exact cause was never determined, the fire began in the undeveloped chaparral and grasslands of  , just east of the ridgeline of the  , and was propelled over the ridge and southwestward just south of   by a strong, gusty, and intensely dry northeasterly wind.
114_san+francisco san+francisco The fire quickly blew up as it swept through the    and  neighborhoods of , overwhelming the capabilities of the    to stop it.

153_san+francisco san+francisco The $8.35 million cost of the earthquakes went mostly to replace buildings damaged beyond repair.
154_san+francisco san+francisco There were at least  aftershocks after the initial pair of earthquakes.
155_san+francisco san+francisco At the time they were the largest earthquakes to affect the northern     since the    earthquake.
156_san+francisco san+francisco The  tectonics of northern  are mainly controlled by the    system, the zone of dextral strike-slip faulting that accommodates displacement between the    and the   along this transform boundary.
157_san+francisco san+francisco In addition to the   Fault itself there are numerous other sub-parallel dextral strike-slip faults that take up some of the plate boundary motion distributed through a zone more than  km wide.
