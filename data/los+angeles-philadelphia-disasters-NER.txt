10_los+angeles los+angeles Surface faulting may have extended beyond the boundaries of the regularly acknowledged slip length.
11_los+angeles los+angeles Researchers recorded  and second-hand accounts of the ground crack, which was understood to be recent surface faulting and not just the topography of the existing rift.
12_los+angeles los+angeles On the extreme northern end of the rupture zone, the surface cracking extended  north of  into   .
13_los+angeles los+angeles On the southern end, the population centers were not as close to the fault, and early observers were probably limited to the stretch of the fault between   and  , as that was close to the  –   .
14_los+angeles los+angeles Evidence of uprooted and displaced trees south of   indicates surface faulting along a "mole track" that ran directly under   .
15_los+angeles los+angeles of the  trees examined were tilted in their lower extremity, while the upper portions remained relatively untilted.
16_los+angeles los+angeles Tree ring dating confirmed that the trees had originated  and     and also that the rings began to grow twice as thick on the side in the direction of the tilt; this is a frequently noted compensation of tree tilt.
17_los+angeles los+angeles Seismologist   determined that fault slip and the associated ground disturbance was the source of the mole track and subsequent tree tilt.
18_los+angeles los+angeles Scientists and public service officials have speculated on the threat of another very large earthquake occurring in southern  and what type and scale of damage might result.
19_los+angeles los+angeles The portion of the fault that ruptured in  has settled into a period of dormancy and this has given rise to suggestions that  slip along that zone may be characterized by a very large -type event followed by another period of inactivity.

83_los+angeles los+angeles This  story reinforced concrete building in   had been built in  when there were few other tall buildings in the area and was located  km northwest of the epicenter.
84_los+angeles los+angeles The decision to equip the building with  strong motion sensors in  176 was based on its size, structural attributes, and location in a seismically active area.
85_los+angeles los+angeles Unusually detailed structural analysis was possible as a result of the building having been outfitted with the instrumentation.
86_los+angeles los+angeles The initial configuration was tested shortly after its installation when a relatively small ( local magnitude) earthquake occurred  kilometers northwest of the building on   .
87_los+angeles los+angeles The accelerations recorded on the equipment during this event proved to be of very low amplitude and, as a result, the instrumentation was upgraded and improved to include a  channel configuration in the building along with a  triaxial ( channel) accelerograph located 40 feet east of the building at ground level.

203_los+angeles los+angeles However, tests of the Camry by "Car  Driver" in , attempting to use the brakes to stop acceleration of a purposely stuck throttle at , ,   mph, found that the test driver was able to reduce speed to  mph in all instances,  in the    mph tests, stop the car completely.
204_los+angeles los+angeles The Camry's braking distances with a purposely stuck accelerator were also shorter than that of the  ' regular stopping distance.
205_los+angeles los+angeles "Car and Driver" concluded that, based on their emergency stopping tests, the Camry's brakes could overcome the accelerator in all cases even without a brake override, and that stopping distances with a wide-open throttle were largely indiscernible from regular braking.
206_los+angeles los+angeles On    ABC News quoted   head of the for-profit firm "   " stating that he had uncovered hundreds of "non-floor mat sudden acceleration cases" which the floor mat recall did not address.

208_los+angeles los+angeles alleged that the problem was not with the accelerator pedals, but with the electronic throttle control systems (ETC).
209_los+angeles los+angeles An electronic throttle control system is a drive-by-wire system, in which the accelerator pedal and the engine are indirectly linked electronically, instead of directly linked mechanically.
210_los+angeles los+angeles This means that input from the accelerator pedal is just  input used to decide how wide the throttle is opened.
211_los+angeles los+angeles On    "The Wall Street Journal" reported that 's company was "controversial" because its income comes from lawsuits against auto manufacturers which was not disclosed in media reports; auto journalists noted that the firm had a "vested interest" in blaming manufacturer defects while avoiding operator error.
212_los+angeles los+angeles The "Los Angeles Times" reported that since  and Lexus began installing electronic throttle control systems in , complaints of unintended acceleration with vehicles from both those brands rose sharply.
213_los+angeles los+angeles Electromagnetic interference with the electronic throttle control system is another possible cause of unintended acceleration.
214_los+angeles los+angeles Some speculated that cosmic rays, or radiation from outer space, was a possible source for alleged electronic malfunctions.
215_los+angeles los+angeles The "Wall Street Journal" reported on    that "safety regulators human-error experts and auto makers say driver error is the primary cause of sudden acceleration."
216_los+angeles los+angeles Regarding the   recalls, "'s Auto" noted that  investigations over   have found that the majority of sudden unintended acceleration cases are due to driver error.
217_los+angeles los+angeles In such cases, accidents are the result of drivers mistakenly stepping on the gas pedal instead of the brake.
218_los+angeles los+angeles On    the "Los Angeles Times" quoted a motor skills consultant stating that the fault in sudden acceleration cases "almost always lies with drivers who step on the wrong pedal."
219_los+angeles los+angeles In  , "Car and Driver" suggested that the alleged accident rate of  in  recalled Toyotas was "highly unlikely" to result from vehicle defects, pointing to an increased danger for drivers who "aren't smart or calm enough to shift to neutral".
220_los+angeles los+angeles , "Forbes" referred to auto industry experts as "skeptical" of defect explanations, suggesting that "driver error and panic account for many reported problems" with recalled Toyotas.
221_los+angeles los+angeles On  ,  , author of "Traffic Safety", claimed that driver behavior was the main factor in Toyota accidents, and that the consensus of   of scientific research is that driver error is the prominent explanation for automotive fatalities.
222_los+angeles los+angeles In  , "Forbes"  , "The "s   and attorney   argued that the fact that most of the incidents of sudden acceleration in  occur in elderly drivers strongly suggest that there is not an electronics problem as opposed to  of pedal misapplication.
223_los+angeles los+angeles 's article was titled: "Why Do Toyotas Hate the Elderly?", and  noted that  immigrants were also twice as likely to be involved.
224_los+angeles los+angeles However, lawsuits filed regarding sudden unintended acceleration cases, along with related third-party investigation reports, have typically avoided the driver error explanation.
225_los+angeles los+angeles On   20 the "  " ran a piece by   PhD pressor emeritus  psychology at      and sudden acceleration researcher suspecting driver error as the primary cause  unexplained  sudden acceleration reports.
226_los+angeles los+angeles pointed to several factors that make driver error more likely: elderly driver age, lack of experience with the car, and short stature.
227_los+angeles los+angeles In addition, unexplained sudden acceleration events were most frequently reported as occurring from low speed or fully stopped.
228_los+angeles los+angeles Typically, the driver was intending to press the brake, and did not consciously confuse the pedals; however, because of advanced age and neuromuscular irregularities, short stature and difficulty reaching the pedals, a slight misalignment in seating position, or unfamiliarity with the car model, the driver's foot contacted the accelerator by mistake.
229_los+angeles los+angeles The resulting unexpected sudden acceleration would lead to panic, with the driver thinking that the acceleration system had failed.
230_los+angeles los+angeles The immediate response would be to brake hard, but not knowing that their foot was on the accelerator, pressing down caused greater acceleration.
231_los+angeles los+angeles In such panic situations, the driver would think that the brakes were not responding, and continue pressing on the gas pedal until they crashed.
232_los+angeles los+angeles Switching to neutral or turning off the ignition was typically not contemplated.
233_los+angeles los+angeles Incidents occurred exclusively in automatic transmission-equipped cars  with driver complaints involving rental cars being far more frequent.
234_los+angeles los+angeles All factors point to reduced driver familiarity and sophistication.

305_los+angeles los+angeles In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the  clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally.
306_los+angeles los+angeles The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds.

320_los+angeles los+angeles It is necessary to mention that   statistics are computed for typical travels for respective forms of transport, so they cannot be used directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel "from A to B".
321_los+angeles los+angeles For example: according to statistics, a typical flight from   to   will carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office.
322_los+angeles los+angeles But a car travel from   to   would not be typical.
323_los+angeles los+angeles It would be as large as several dozens of typical car travels, and associated risk will be larger as well.
324_los+angeles los+angeles Because the journey would take a much longer time, the overall risk associated by making this journey by car will be higher th making the same journey by air, even if each individual  of car travel c be less risky th   of flight.

334_los+angeles los+angeles In , the AVJUHSD challenged the constitutionality of  Proposition , which placed a cap on county real estate taxes.
335_los+angeles los+angeles The proposition limited property tax assessments to the  standard, eliminating $7 billion of the $11.4 billion in property tax revenue collected each year.
336_los+angeles los+angeles According to the "Washington Post", the "severe" limitations this imposed on state funding forced local governments and most school districts in  to make "drastic cutbacks".
337_los+angeles los+angeles Furthermore, an article in the "Los Angeles Times" noted that Federal aid money for  schools, worth about $98 million each year, may be reduced if state-funded programs are cut.
338_los+angeles los+angeles A recent  report had found that Proposition  would not result in any major "local spending" cuts.
339_los+angeles los+angeles In order to receive Federal aid, the state needed to maintain  levels of spending on local programs or secure local matching funds.

152_philadelphia philadelphia She rapidly organized a conference in  with treatment providers, emergency responders, emergency room professionals, law enforcement officials, representatives from city governments, other healthcare professionals,  to create a coordinated response to eliminate this threat to life.
153_philadelphia philadelphia Within  and for a number of reasons, fentanyl overdose deaths declined rapidly.
154_philadelphia philadelphia Of over  media events and interviews during her term, she gave  interviews on  distribution to heroin addicts and friends.
155_philadelphia philadelphia At that time, she strongly supported narcan rescue by trained healthcare personnel, but opposed distribution to heroin users and their friends, of overdose rescue kits of opiate-antidote naloxone (Narcan) in i.v. or nasal spray form.
156_philadelphia philadelphia Her opposition was based on discussions with  and  and a scientific literature survey by .
157_philadelphia philadelphia She voiced opposition to "take-home" narcan on the basis of inadequate scientific evidence to support this policy and on the basis of several publications of potential adverse outcomes.
158_philadelphia philadelphia " says drug users aren't likely to be competent to deal with an overdose emergency".
159_philadelphia philadelphia This quote was based on a several studies and the views of EMT responders, e.g.
160_philadelphia philadelphia Seal et al., , that indicated risks related to naloxone administration to opioid-dependent people, by untrained personnel.
161_philadelphia philadelphia Her opposition to "take-home" narcan arose from a number of factors cited in an   .
162_philadelphia philadelphia These included quoting Seal's detailed study of heroin – injectors in the    area,.
163_philadelphia philadelphia In this survey of  street-recruited 's who had experienced  or more heroin overdose events, 51% reported soliciting emergency assistance, 87% were in favor of participating in an overdose training program, "35% predicted they would feel comfortable using greater amounts of heroin if they had narcan in their possession, 62% would be less inclined to call  for an overdose, 30% would leave an overdose victim after nalox resusitation," and 46% might not be able to dissuade the victim from using heroin again to alleviate withdrawal symptoms induced by nalox.
164_philadelphia philadelphia Another article published by  , raised concerns that i) "the induction of an acute withdrawal syndrome (the occurrence of vomiting and aspiration is potentially life threatening)" – and that could lead to abandonment by a narcan provider/friend; ii) "the effect of naloxone may wear off prematurely when used for treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression and require multiple doses and long-term vigilance".
