362_new+orleans new+orleans Responsibility for the design and construction  the levee system belongs to the      ; the responsibility  maintenance belongs to the local levee boards.
363_new+orleans new+orleans The Corps hands components of the system over to the local levee boards upon completion.
364_new+orleans new+orleans When  struck in , the project was between 60-90% complete.
365_new+orleans new+orleans investigations ( major and  minor) were conducted by civil engineers and other experts, in an attempt to identify the underlying reasons for the failure of the federal flood protection system.
366_new+orleans new+orleans All concur that the primary cause  the flooding was inadequate design and construction by the   .
367_new+orleans new+orleans On    flood walls and levees catastrophically failed throughout the metro area.
368_new+orleans new+orleans Some – the extent of which is disputed – collapsed well below design thresholds ( Street and  Canals).
369_new+orleans new+orleans Others collapsed after a brief period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused "scouring" or erosion of the earthen levee walls – a design flaw.
370_new+orleans new+orleans In  , the      called the flooding    "the worst engineering catastrophe in  History."
371_new+orleans new+orleans The primary mechanisms of failure at the  Street ,    and Industrial  (east side north) were improper design.
372_new+orleans new+orleans The failure mechanism for the   (east side south and west side) was  overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge.
373_new+orleans new+orleans The primary mechanism of failure for levees protecting eastern   was the existence of sand in 10% of places instead of thick  clay.
374_new+orleans new+orleans The primary mechanism  failure for the levees protecting St.   was overtopping due to negligent maintenance  the    , a navigation channel, by the   .
375_new+orleans new+orleans The engineers responsible for the design of the canal levees and the  embedded in them overestimated the soil strength, meaning that the soil strength used in the design calculations was greater than what actually existed under and near the levee during Hurricane Katrina.
376_new+orleans new+orleans They made an unconservative (i.e., erring toward unsafe) interpretations of the data: the soil below the levee was actually weaker than that used in the  design (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg ).
377_new+orleans new+orleans Another critical engineering oversight that led to the failure of the  Street Canal involves not taking into account the possibility of a water-filled gap which turned out to be a very important aspect of the failures of the  around  .
378_new+orleans new+orleans “Analysis indicate that, with the presence of a water-filled gap, the factor of safety is about 30 percent lower.
379_new+orleans new+orleans Because a factor of safety of  was used for design, a reduction of 30 percent would reduce the factor of safety to approximately : a condition of incipient failure.”
380_new+orleans new+orleans (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg )
381_new+orleans new+orleans Nation of  leader   among other public figures claimed the levees were dynamited to divert waters away from wealthy white areas.
382_new+orleans new+orleans The conspiracy theory reached a      committee investigating Katrina when a   community activist made the claim.
383_new+orleans new+orleans The theory became according to the "   " an "urban myth".
384_new+orleans new+orleans Reasons for belief in these theories were ascribed to the decision by city officials during    Flood of  to set off  tons of dynamite on the levee at ,  which eased pressure on levees at   but flooded   , the  Ward taking the brunt of the city's flooding during Hurricane , the general disenfranchisement of blacks and lower-class people, and the similarity of sound of the levees collapsing to that of a bombing.
385_new+orleans new+orleans Investigators focused on the  Street and   canals, where evidence showed they were breached even though water did not flow over their tops, indicating a design or construction flaw.
386_new+orleans new+orleans Eyewitness accounts and other evidence show that levees and flood walls in other parts of the city, such as along the Industrial Canal, were topped by floodwaters , then breached or eroded.
387_new+orleans new+orleans Many   levee and flood wall failures in the wake  Hurricane  occurred at weak-link junctions where different levee or wall sections joined together according to a preliminary report released on   005 carried out by independent investigators from the     and the      (ASCE).
388_new+orleans new+orleans Dr.  , chair of an independent levee investigation team, has said that the   design firm  and  could have followed correct procedures in calculating safety factors for the flood walls.
389_new+orleans new+orleans He added, however, that design procedures of the Corps may not account for changes in soil strength caused by the changes in water flow and pressure during a hurricane flood.
390_new+orleans new+orleans Dr.  has also questioned the size of the design safety margins.
391_new+orleans new+orleans He said the corps applied a 30% margin over the maximum design load.
392_new+orleans new+orleans A doubling of strength would be a more typical margin for highway bridges, dams, off-shore oil platforms and other public structures.
