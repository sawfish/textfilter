246_miami miami Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered.
247_miami miami Most survivors and bodies were washed out into the  where many of the bodies were never found.
248_miami miami As the rear eyewall passed over the area, the flood reversed itself, breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing a similar but smaller flood.
249_miami miami Floodwaters persisted for  , greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation.
250_miami miami Burial services were quickly overwhelmed, and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves.
251_miami miami Around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers, making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this, the count of the dead is not very accurate.
