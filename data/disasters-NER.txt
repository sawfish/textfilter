  before the   Fire, this was the greatest fire yet seen in an  city.	
It started in a boat house on Commercial Street, likely caused by a firecracker or a cigar ash.	
The fire spread to a lumber yard and on to a sugar house, then spread across the city, eventually burning out on   in the city's east end.	
Only  people died in the fire but  were made homeless and  buildings were burned to the ground.	
This included the federal Exchange Building by which was replaced with the custom house.	
Soon after the fire, poet    described his old home town: "Desolation!

Just before the noon , severe thunderstorms began forming  west of downtown .	
The  storm started to spawn killer tornadoes in  and then Kane Counties starting at 12:00 pm.	
Roughly    a violent F4 tornado tore through Will and Cook Counties cutting a path  long in the  and  areas that would kill  people as the storm devastated the community of Melrose Park.

This  twister was a harbinger of things to come as the morning went on and the atmosphere began to destabilize, due to the abundance of sunshine that preceded the cold front in the warm sector, which covered the lower Great Lakes region extending southward well  the   .	

Weather forecasters and the public alike in the , ,  , , South Bend, and  areas were unaware that the stage was set that  for a tragic tornado outbreak that would follow on a balmy and seemingly tranquil Palm Sun afternoon.	
The weather maps in use in  showed a rather large and deep cyclone over northern  that was forecast to move across central Lower  by nightfall with a trailing cold front.	
Meteorologists knew rain showers and perhaps a thundershower was a good possibility, but were unaware that the helicity, lifted index, and upper level winds were being guided by a strong jet stream with a probable negative-tilt that would create favorable conditions for the development of tornadoes.	

As the Palm  storms swept quickly out of the  area across  , they moved towards 's  .

Although the official paid attendance was recorded as , newspaper accounts reported that only  actually attended, as the game was played in a heavy rainstorm on a cold afternoon.	
The rain turned the field into a "sea of mud" with an inch of standing water on top of the mud.	
In the "  ",   (who also served as the game's referee) compared the field to a "bog" and added:"In my   of football I have never seen worse conditions.	
Pools of water stood on parts of the field and in some places the players' feet sunk into the field  or  inches.	
It rained throughout the game and a strong wind from the north gave the team defending that goal a decided advantage."	
The conditions on the field were so poor that the schools' marching bands declined the usual halftime parade across the field and instead played from the cinder path around the field.	

 , head  the  fice  the      described the damage: "Our investigation convinced me that the tragedy resulted from an explosion somewhere in the region  the baggage compartment in the rear  the plane.	
Everything in front of the compartment was blown forward, everything behind blown backward, and things at the side outward."	
He also noted: "The gasoline tanks, instead of being blown out, were crushed in, showing there was no explosion in them."

The nursing home was equipped with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the   .	
The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated.	
The manual fire alarm system consisted of  pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and  fire alarm box located at the entrance of the building.	
The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the  floor, both stairways and in the storage closet.	
The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors.	
On the  floor,  fire extinguishers and  public address loud speakers were installed.	

The " Wincrest Nursing Home fire" took place on     in  .	
The fire occurred when an arsonist set a wardrobe closet on fire at the    building, located at  N. Winthrop Avenue.	
The alarm sounded at 11:30 a.m. and the fire was put out at 1:30 p.m.
Although the building itself sustained minor smoke, fire and water damage,  people died from smoke inhalation.	
A    housekeeper was arrested by authorities and was charged with multiple counts of arson.	

The fire was put out at 1:28 p.m. CDT.	
The room where the fire broke out was completely gutted and the adjacent corridor sustained only moderate smoke and heat damage.	
 other rooms also suffered heat and smoke damage.	
No smoke damage was evident on the  or  floors and water damage was minor.	
However despite the minor damage to the building,  fatalities were reported due to smoke inhalation.	
An investigation made by the    and fire department.	
The survivors claimed that the fire was started in a plywood wardrobe closet in   which was unoccupied at the time.	
Although the actual cause  the fire was unknown, the     arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts  arson.	
It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the fire was an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the fire were never noted.	

At the time of the fire, the building was occupied by  residents,  nurses,  aides and  office, kitchen and maintenance staff.	
 of the residents were in the chapel room on the  floor of the building.	
Fire was reported in room  by a nurse’s aide who pulled the fire alarm box.	
The alarm was received by the    at 11:43 A.M (CDT).	
Attempts to put out the fire by staff proved to no avail.	
The  fire engine arrived at the scene of the fire   and    as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building.	
More fire engines arrived   as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building.	
At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the  floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs.	
The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals.	

The "  Loop derailment" occurred on    when a    elevated train rear-ended another on the northeast corner of the Loop at   and   during the evening rush .	
The collision forced the   cars of the rear train off the elevated tracks, killing  people and injuring over  as the cars fell onto the street below.	
It remains the single worst accident in the agency's history.	

According to the  ,   had "the worst record in the nation" for issuing warnings for severe storms, only issuing warnings 24% of the time when a warning was justifiable.	
Even , many meteorologists refer to the " Syndrome" as the idea that it's better to issue too many warnings and be wrong than to miss  critical warning, as was the case for the  Tornado.	
At some point after the  tornado, the    reduced the  office's workload by creating an office in ,  and allowing offices in the Quad Cities,  , , ,  and ,  to issue forecasts for their respective areas.	

The "  tornado" was a devastating tornado that occurred on the afternoon of    .	
The violent tornado killed  people and injured .	
It is the only F5 tornado ever recorded in  and the only F5 tornado to ever strike the  area.	
There are few known videos or photographs of the tornado.	

Conditions were ripe for severe thunderstorm development, and with both low level and high level steering winds from the west-northwest, the      issued a  Thunderstorm Watch for northern  valid 1:30 p.m. through 8:00 p.m. CDT that night.	
The  predicted a derecho-type event for later that night as rapidly developing thunderstorms along a cold front in  would be carried by the steering flow into the  area.	
 of these storms developed supercellular characteristics south of , steering  to  degrees to the right of prevailing steering winds.	
By , mid-level steering winds had begun to veer, causing a wind profile slightly more favorable for tornadic development.	
This helped develop a high precipitation supercell.	

In   following  tornado,   Wear  was heavily criticized for providing no warning of  approaching tornado.	
The  Disaster Survey Report was highly critical of the forecast process within the  office as well as coordination with local spotter networks and the preparedness of these groups.	
Prior to , the    in  was responsible for providing forecasts for the entire state of .	

As the  office was overwhelmed with its workload, no warnings were issued by the office until 2:32 p.m. &mdash;    after the  tornado was sighted southeast of .	
  severe thunderstorm warning was issued almost     3:23 p.m., but this provided no indicion th a tornado was on the ground d did not mention the area where the tornado had tracked.	
No tornado warning was issued until after the tornado lifted.	

In eastern ,    shattered many of    snowfall records.

The "  heat wave" was a heat wave which led to approximately  heat-related deaths in  over a period of  .	
 , author of the  book "Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in ", has noted that in the  , the loss of human life in hot spells in  exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.	
The heat wave heavily impacted the wider Midwestern region, with additional deaths in both  ,  and , , as well.	

The temperatures soared to record highs in  with the hottest weather occurring from   to  .	
The high of  on   was the  warmest  temperature (warmest being  set on   ) since records began at     in .	
Nighttime low temperatures were unusually high; in the upper 70s and lower  F (about  C)&mdash;as well.	
Record humidity levels also accompanied the hot weather.	
The heat index reached  at  airport, and  at  .	

Impacts in the  urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than .	
Urban heat islands are caused by  concentration of buildings and pavement in urban areas, which tend to absorb more heat in   and radiate less heat at night into ir immediate surroundings than comparable rural sites.	
Therefore, built-up areas get hotter and stay hotter.	

Other aggravating factors were inadequate warnings, power failures, inadequate ambulance service and hospital facilities, and lack of preparation.	
City officials did not release a heat emergency warning until    of  heat wave.	
Thus, such emergency measures as 's  cooling centers were not fully utilized.	
The medical system of  was severely taxed as thousands were taken to local hospitals with heat-related problems.	

Another powerful factor in the heat wave was that a temperature inversion grew over the city, and air stagnated in this situation.	
Pollutants and humidity were confined to ground level, and the air was becalmed and devoid of wind.	
Without wind to stir the air, temperatures grew even hotter than could be expected with just an urban heat island, and without wind there was truly no relief.	
Without any way to relieve the heat, even the inside of homes became ovens, with indoor temperature exceeding  at night.	
This was especially noticeable in areas which experienced frequent power outages.	
At   just north of ,  school students lived in dormitories without air conditioning.	
In order to ease the effects of the heat, some of the students slept at night with water-soaked towels as blankets.	

About  people were on the top wooden balcony at the time of the collapse.	
According to  witness, the sound of splintering wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time.	
The collapse started on the  floor, pulling down other balconies below.	
The , ,   floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately   people among them.	
Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell.	
Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others.	
 of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived.	
The    supplied the main rescue effort.	
 people were killed in the collapse, with  more subsequently dying while hospitalized;  people were injured.	

In , the city of  filed a negligence lawsuit against  of the survivors,   and  .	
The city alleged that the  balcony collapse occurred after defendants Fenton-Hathaway and  "intentionally and negligently" began jumping up and down on the porch.	
's brother,  , was killed in the collapse.	
The charges against Fenton-Hathaway and  were later dropped.	

On    the deadliest porch collapse in   history occurred in .	
An overloaded balcony collapsed during a party in an apartment building, killing  people and seriously injuring  others.	
The ensuing investigation was highly critical of the way the balcony was built, finding a large number of errors in its construction which ultimately resulted in the collapse.	
However, the building's owner continues to blame overcrowding on the balcony for its complete structural failure, although he has taken steps to strengthen the balconies at his properties to prevent a recurrence of the disaster.	
The accident resulted in sweeping inspections of  similar structures across , with  cases being actioned by the city authorities.	

As the evacuating crowd pushed open the doors, several people already climbing the stairs were knocked down and subsequently pinned by the ensuing crush.	
Security attempted to pull them to safety, but the pile rapidly reached  feet in height as a result of more than  simultaneously attempting to escape the chaos inside.	
 , a former E2 guard who had worked at trying to free trapped patrons, recalled to the "Chicago Sun-Times" in   that he had heard other clubbers atop the stairs laughing at the fracas, unaware of the fatalities stemming from the ground-floor pileup.

 , a large futures exchange, stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on   were concerned, its investigation found no evidence that high-frequency trading played a role, and in fact concluded that automated trading had contributed to market stability during the period of the crash.	
Others speculate that an intermarket sweep order may have played a role in triggering the crash.	
#"The fat-finger theory:" "Disproved."	
In the immediate aftermath of the plunge, several reports indicated that the event may have been triggered by a fat-finger trade, an inadvertent large "sell order" for    stock, inciting massive algorithmic trading orders to dump the stock; however, this theory was quickly disproved after it was determined that   's decline occurred after a significant decline in the E-mini SP  Futures contracts.	
The "fat-finger trade" hypothesis was also disproved when it was determined that existing   and ICE safeguards would have prevented such an error.	
, the fat-finger theory is not considered credible.	
#"Impact of High Frequency traders:" "Regulators found HFT's exacerbated price declines."	
As noted above, regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines.	
Regulators determined that high frequency traders sold aggressively to eliminate their positions and withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.	
A   report by the      () an international body  securities regulators concluded that while "algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk their usage was also clearly a contributing factor in the flash crash event    ."	
Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) was the underlying cause of the flash crash.	
 hypothesis based on the analysis of bid-offer data by   is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-offer spread) to exchanges in batches.	
Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.	
However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.	
Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on  .	
On    the regulators probing the crash concluded: "that quote-stuffing – placing and then almost immediately cancelling large numbers of rapid-fire orders to buy or sell stocks – was not a “major factor” in the turmoil."	
Some have put forth the theory  trading actually have been a major factor in minimizing and reversing the flash crash.	
#"Large directional bets:" "Regulators say a large E-Mini   seller set off a chain of events triggering the Flash Crash, but did not identify the firm."	
Earlier, some investigators suggested that a large purchase of put options on the   index by the hedge fund   shortly before the crash may have been among the primary causes.	
Other reports have speculated that the event may have been triggered by a single sale of  E-mini   contracts valued at around $4 billion by the  ,  firm    on the   .	
Others suspect a movement in the  Dollar to   exchange rate.	
#"Changes in market structure:" Some market structure experts speculate that, whatever the underlying causes, equity markets are vulnerable to these sort of events because of decentralization of trading.	
#"Technical glitches:" An analysis of trading on the exchanges during the moments immediately prior to the flash crash reveals technical glitches in the reporting of prices on the  and various ATSs that might have contributed to the drying up of liquidity.	
According to this theory, technical problems at the  led to delays as long as   in  quotes being reported on the Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) with time stamps indicating that the quotes were .	
However, some market participants (those with access to 's own quote reporting system, OpenBook) could see both correct   quotes, as well as the delayed but apparently  CQS quotes.	
At the same time, there were errors in the prices of some stocks ( , , and some ETFs).	
Confused and uncertain about prices, many market participants attempted to drop out of the market by posting stub quotes (very low bids and very high offers) and, at the same time, many high-frequency trading algorithms attempted to exit the market with market orders (which were executed at the stub quotes) leading to a domino effect that resulted in the flash crash plunge.

The aerial cloudscapes painted by   in   and  are a special case.	
Many of them are not landscapes at all, since they don't show any land.	
They depict images of clouds viewed from above, suspended in blue sky, with the land below nowhere to be seen; it is the view of clouds regarded at a downward and sideways angle, as from the window of an airplane.	
These paintings depict a kind of "pseudo-horizon," formed not where land meets sky but where the suspended layer of clouds—a "pseudo-ground"—meets the empty upper sky.

Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air,  then used his theory to devise a scheme explaining the origins and nature of the earth as well as of the surrounding celestial bodies.	
Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air.	
In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky,  proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars.	
While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion.Kirk, ,  , and  .

The moon and sun are likewise considered to be flat and floating on streams of air, and when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant; the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth is likened by  to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.Fairbanks, .

 used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well.	
Earthquakes he asserted were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of overabundance thereof, which also causes cracks in the earth because of the excess of water.	
In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks and hills collapse, causing earthquakes.	
Lightning is also caused by a violent separation, this time of clouds by winds to create a bright, fire-like flash.

The  and only tropical storm of the season originated in a tropical wave, as indicated by weather maps from  .	
The  hurricane database initially listed the system as a tropical cyclone by  , although the  reanalysis concluded that a closed low pressure system had not yet developed.	
Maps from   display a weak low north of The ; however, other observations place the new cyclone further south.	
Decreases in air pressure occurred throughout the islands, providing "strong indications of a disturbance".	
The system is officially estimated to have become a tropical depression at  UTC on  , approximately  east of , .	
It became a tropical storm     and, that same evening, storm warnings were issued from the east coast of  to as far north as ,  .

At 5 PM (EST), the tropical storm warnings were then changed to hurricane warnings which extended to the  .	
On the , however, the hurricane did not recurve north and warnings for  and later the  Keys were dropped, as the storm instead continued west-northwest.	
Because the  hurricane was large (exact size unknown), forecasters began to issue tropical storm warnings from coastal  to the  .	
In addition, warnings were issued in , .	
Since it was clear that the hurricane would make landfall in , the warnings were changed for the entire  coastline.	
After the hurricane made landfall, officials continued to issue warnings until the storm dissipated on  .

A ship reported a minimum central pressure of  mbar ( inHg) near  , suggesting that the cyclone may have been stronger.	
On  , the hurricane turned east-northeast in response to the southward movement of a ridge, and it quickly weakened.	
Early on  , it struck   near ,  as a Category  hurricane, and it entered the   north of  with  mph (0 km/h) winds.	
The cyclone steadily weakened as it moved across the western  , and it dissipated west-southwest of  on  .	
Following reanalysis released in  , the storm was re-classified as a Category  with winds of 16 mph ( km/h) and a minimum pressure of  mbar (hPa).	
This makes   the earliest Category  recorded in the   and ties it with   for the  most intense storm ever recorded in the .	

  prior to striking , the outer circulation began producing rainfall across the state.	
Storm warnings were issued along the east and west coastlines northward to Cedar Key and .	
Later, hurricane warnings were issued for much of the same area, and schools in the  area were closed as the storm was expected to move ashore.	
The hurricane  affected  when it passed west of  , where sustained winds of  mph ( km/h), along with gusts to  mph ( km/h), were reported.	
Little damage occurred in the region, limited to downed trees; this was due to advanced warning by the   , which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property.	
Later, the hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern .	
Damage was reported in   and   and communications were temporarily cut, although no deaths were reported.	
Heavy rainfall was reported along its path, and  location accumulated  inches ( mm) in a   period; this established a new -day rainfall record in the state.	
A station in  recorded  inches ( mm), and wind gusts in the area approached hurricane force.	
The combination of winds and rain damaged 5% of the local citrus and avocado crop.	
The rainfall flooded streets, homes, and commercial buildings in the  area, and hundreds of people were left without telephone access.	
No impact was reported in the .	

After exiting  into the   , the hurricane weakened greatly.	
On   it passed a short distance west of  , , and very early on   the hurricane moved over   with winds of  mph ( km/h).	
The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over .	
It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the   in  .	
Gradually weakening, the storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on   it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front.	

During its passage through , the storm produced torrential rain over coastal cities, peaking in  at .	
The storm caused significant property and crop damage along the    .	
Trees, power lines, and telegraph wires were knocked down by high winds along the  .	
Communication throughout southern  was severed as miles of telegraph wires were downed during the evening of  .	
Structures  considered safe from storms due to their location over  ft ( m) inland sustained significant damage, probably from storm surge.	
Beaches along the  coast also sustained considerable damages from the storm.	
 people were killed near  in  separate incidents .	
The  occurred when a house collapsed on  men, pinning them to the ground.	
The  incident occurred after a woman ran outside her home and was struck by a tree limb.	
At least  workmen were killed and  others injured after the bunkhouse they were sleeping in collapsed due to high winds.	
The facility in which they were working in also sustained $200,000 in damage from a fire ignited by the cyclone.

The "  tornado" was a strong tornado that struck    on   .	
It remains the deadliest tornado to affect the south  , and it is estimated to have been the most intense tornado to strike the  area.	
The tornado caused  deaths and produced damage totals that were estimated near $200– ( USD).	
 people were also hospitalized because of injuries.	
The tornado remains the only tornado to cause multiple fatalities in  .	
It is estimated that the tornado may have produced "F3" damage based on photographs taken after the passage of the thunderstorm.	

The exact path and strength of the tornado is uncertain, since it occurred prior to modern records which began in .	
The  tornadoes to directly receive damage ratings on the  scale occurred in .	
The  tornado was  reported in its formative stage over the  near , where several golfers noted a funnel cloud around 1:00 p.m. Hail was reported with the parent thunderstorm prior to the sighting of the funnel cloud.	
The slow movement of the storm was accompanied by a large amount of people outside during the  afternoon, which led to a considerable amount of reports; several reports originated from passing motorists.	
The vortex touched down around 1:15 p.m., and the tornado was described as a "very slender" funnel that frequently lifted from the ground for brief periods.	
The debris swirling around the rotation was compared to smoke from "burning oil."	
Later, the slow moving tornado passed over a dairy farm, killing  person and injuring  people.	
Losses from the farm reached $100,000.	
The tornado eventually intensified and destroyed numerous properties northwest and north of the city of , causing at least  deaths.	
Some residents successfully attempted to flee in automobiles, though the cars were wrecked and some were thrown for distances.	
The tornado became rain wrapped, weakened, and dissipated over the northern portion of  , though it destroyed some power poles along the eastern half of its damage path.	
Hail associated with the storm was measured to  inches ( cm) in diameter, damaging automobiles and residences' roofs.	
The damage path was less than  yards ( miles) in width, and the funnel was visible for   .	
The thunderstorm also affected the communities of Ojus,  ,  , and  .	
In total, the tornado demolished nearly  residences.	

In , impacts were apparently minimal.	
The cyclone produced sustained winds up to  and pressures as low as  in the .	
In  , the cyclone apparently did not produce tropical storm-force winds, although thunderstorms produced  of rainfall at , , on  .	
No severe effects occurred and the storm was not mentioned in the monthly notations of the local  Weather Bureau office in .	
However, its presence and that of the   hurricane, then of Category  intensity and in the  , caused confusion in the local press.	
On the morning   ,   before the  hurricane struck, the " " published a front-page story on the weak tropical storm in the    and included statements by the editors that it was not anticipated to strike ;  news articles on the hurricane, which was expected to deliver “destructive winds” to the area, were not published by other local newspapers until the afternoon, leaving  residents confused as to the extent  the danger.	

Early on  , as Hurricanes  and  remained active in the  , a weak tropical depression formed in the western   about  east-southeast of the  , .	
Without strengning substantially,  depression moved west-northwest for    and a half, passing north of    based upon wear reports, and n curved northward.	
On  , the depression gradually curved to the northeast, and on the afternoon of   its center made landfall southeast of the city of , .	
The cyclone then crossed the central region of , entering the  islands in the evening.	
Shortly thereafter, by   on   the depression intensified into a weak tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of , the strongest in its entire life span.	
The cyclone then turned north, passing about  west of the  capital  in the afternoon.	
The weak storm n turned abruptly to  northwest, having been trapped by a building ridge, and    , while centered north of  , it assumed a gradual curve to  southwest.	
Late that , it degenerated back into a tropical depression and dissipated over the Straits of  on  , as the   hurricane approached from just  to the east-southeast.	

By   on  —just   after the formation of the preceding cyclone—a new tropical storm formed in the  about  east of the island of , though it probably originated earlier and was undetected; operationally, the storm was not tracked until  .	
Steadily moving north of due west,  cyclone quickly became a hurricane   , and over    s, while bypassing  Greater Antilles to  north, it continued to intensify to a major hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of at least , yet few ships were near  eye with which to determine its path.	
On  afternoon of  ,  cyclone peaked at , near  upper threshold of  modern- classification Category , and shortly reafter passed just  north of  island of  , striking  at peak intensity    .	
Continuing over the   and   on  –, the cyclone, with winds of , then struck   near ,  south of  , shortly before   on  , with its large eye passing over the  metropolitan area.	
Swiftly crossing southernmost , the potent hurricane weakened slightly before entering the    near   in the afternoon, and its path gradually curved northwest on  .	
Late on  , its path slowed drastically and curved west, making landfall near  , , with winds of  and a measured pressure of  in the calm eye.	
Quickly weakening thereafter, the cyclone paralleled the coasts of  and , dissipating      over .	

Throughout the , reports of damage were relatively scarce despite the intensity with which the storm struck the region.	
However, numerous structures were completely destroyed.	
Within  of the hurricane striking , newspapers reported death tolls as high as , fearing catastrophic damage in the city.	
This number gradually decreased as persons initially feared dead were found alive.	
According to estimates in   ,  storm was responsible for  deaths in  Souastern  ,  of which took place in  and at least  at  , where a storm surge estimated as high as  overtopped portions of a levee on  .	
Prior to , the  death toll was long listed as .	
Many people in , transients who knew little of hurricanes, perished after examining damage during the passage of the eye, unaware that the back end of the storm was approaching.	
Flimsy structures built to house workers during   land boom of   were completely leveled.	
The hurricane partially contributed to the end of the land boom, which was in decline by  .	
In terms of monetary losses, damage from the hurricane was estimated to be as high as $125 million ($  US$).	
Up to  structures throughout southern  were destroyed and  damaged, leaving at least  people homeless.	
A storm surge of  occurred south of  and winds on   were recorded at  before the anemometer blew away.	
The lowest pressure was estimated at , the  most intense in a storm to strike the  .	
The storm also produced significant damage, rainfall up to , and a storm surge up to  in the  .	
The entire state of  lost 35% of its grapefruit and orange crops combined, including nearly 100% losses in the  area.	
In a study of hurricane damage statistics conducted in , it was estimated that if a storm similar to that of the  hurricane were to occur in  it would result in over $140–  in damage.	
In all, the storm caused at least  deaths along its path accounting for the revised toll in the  since .	

  after the   hurricane struck , the  tropical storm of the season formed in the east-central  about  southwest of  in the  on  .	
Over    , it moved north of due east and rapidly strengned, becoming a minimal hurricane by   on   and later peaking at —equivalent to a moderately strong Category  hurricane on  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale—on  morning of  4.	
For    thereafter, the cyclone briefly curved to the northeast before turning sharply to the east early on  .	
Late that , the cyclone swerved precipitously to the north, making landfall on the island of   near   at peak intensity, becoming only the  of  confirmed hurricanes to strike the  since records began in , the other being Hurricane Hannah in , another landfalling Category  hurricane that struck the same island.	
Curving northwest and then south of due west, the cyclone weakened after striking   and reverted to a minimal hurricane late on  .	
It gradually completed a counter-clockwise loop through the western , curving due south as a tropical storm, though its cool surface temperatures and enlarged size suggest it might have been a subtropical cyclone then.	
Just afterward, late on  , it hit   near  with sustained winds near .	
Over    , it moved generally south-souast and slowly weakened, curving suddenly east-souast beginning on  .	
Turning south of due east, it dissipated by   on  .	

The   hurricane formed on  .	
Moving west-northwest while traversing the tropical , the storm later passed near   on  .	
By   it was battering the , impacting the  and   with winds estimated at .	
Then, in       , it made landfall just south   between   and   as a devastating Category  hurricane on  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.	
The storm crossed the peninsula south   , entered the   , and made another landfall near Mobile,  as a Category  hurricane on    hooking westward along coastal  and , eventually dissipating on   after moving inland over .	

In , winds on the ground were reported around  and the pressure measured at  — though all such data is suspect.	
Most of the costl inhbitnts hd not evcuted, prtly becuse of short wrning ( hurricne wrning ws issued just    before lndfll) nd prtly becuse the "young" city's popultion knew little bout the dnger  mjor hurricne posed.	
A  storm surge inundated the area, causing massive property damage and some fatalities.	
As the eye of the hurricane crossed over   and downtown , many people believed the storm had passed.	
Some tried to leave the barrier islands, only to be swept off the bridges by the rear eyewall.	
"The lull lasted  , and during that time the streets of the city became crowded with people," wrote  , the local weather chief.	
"As a result, many lives were lost during the  phase of the storm."	

Coastal regions between Mobile and ,  also suffered heavy damage from wind, rain, and storm surge, but this paled beside the news of the destruction in .	
According to the   there were  fatalities.	
Other estimates vary, since there were a large number of people listed as "missing".	
Between  and  people were left homeless, mostly in the  area.	

The damage from the storm was immense; few buildings in  or   were left intact.	
The toll for the storm was $100 million ($  USD).	
It is estimated that if an identical storm hit in   , with modern development and prices,  storm would have caused $140–  in damage.	
After the hurricane, the Great Depression started in  , slowing recovery.	

The University of , located in  , had been founded in  and opened its doors for the  time just  after the hurricane passed.	
The University's athletic teams were nicknamed the Hurricanes in memory of this catastrophe.	
The school's mascot is , an ibis.	
The ibis is a small white bird that can be seen around south  and especially on the UM campus.	
An ibis was selected to represent the Hurricanes because of folklore in which it is typically the last bird to leave before a hurricane strikes and the  to return  it's gone.	

The "  hurricane" (or "Great  Hurricane") was a Category  hurricane that devastated  in  .	
The storm also caused significant damage in the  , the  state of , and the .	
The storm's enormous regional economic impact helped end   land boom of   and pushed  region on an early start into  Great Depression.	

Points further south along the  coast, such as , received only a brush from the storm, resulting in rains and some light wind damage.	
Flooding was also experienced at points such as  .	
Damage estimates in  exceeded $2.5 million.	

In the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal , it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings.	
Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings.	
Coming on the heels of the   hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed,  lasting result of the  storm was improved building codes.	

Thousands of people were left homeless in ; property damage was estimated at $25 million ($).	
It is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of   , it would cause $18.7 billion in damages.

Coastal damage in  near the point of landfall was catastrophic.	
, well south of the point of landfall, escaped with very little damage;  and   suffered only slight damages.	
In  , numerous power lines and telephone wires were downed.	
Northward, from   to , buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and  ft ( m) storm surge, which was heaviest in the vicinity of  ; total coastal damages were estimated as "several " dollars.	
In   , more than  homes were destroyed, while the   's mortar was reportedly "squeezed ...like toothpaste" between the bricks during the storm, swaying the tower  off the base.	
Because of well-issued hurricane warnings, residents were prepared for the storm, and the number of lives lost in the coastal   area was only .	
Inland, the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of  .	
Residents had been warned to evacuate  low ground earlier in  , but after  hurricane did not arrive on schedule, many thought it had missed and returned to ir homes.	
When the worst of the storm crossed the lake—with winds measured on the ground at around  mph ( km/h)—the south-blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake.	
The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over  ft ( m) deep.	
Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered.	
Most survivors and bodies were washed out into the  where many of the bodies were never found.	
As the rear eyewall passed over the area, the flood reversed itself, breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing a similar but smaller flood.	
Floodwaters persisted for  , greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation.	
Burial services were quickly overwhelmed, and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves.	
Around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers, making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this, the count of the dead is not very accurate.	
The   estimated the number of fatalities as , which was taken as the official count by the    for many  (and exactly equal to the official count for Hurricane Katrina).	
Older sources usually list  as the hurricane's total count of fatalities, including the .	
However, in  the  death count was revised as "at least" , making the  hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in   history behind the  Hurricane of .

Due to the floods, septic tanks overflowed, leaving canal banks and patches of ground isolated by floodwaters; reportedly,  Route , locally called Federal Highway and built largely upon the  coastal ridge—the highest elevation in  —was flooded out between  and  .	
Having been isolated by the floods, deer, rattlesnakes, and other wildlife, along with horses and cattle, sought shelter upon the remaining exposed ground, particularly levee banks.	

In  , the flooding from the  and  hurricanes led to the creation in  of what is  the     , which under a  plan was entrusted with the task of preventing a recurrence of significant flooding by forming an improved flood-control system to modulate the water table and by providing suitable water levels with which to water crops, prevent saltwater intrusion, and support recreational opportunities as well as the growing   communities.	
Large pumping systems were constructed, along with numerous new levees and canals, to mitigate  risk of large-scale flooding, yet population growth since    is believed to have reduced  extent of vacant lands needed for effective drainage, reby increasing  risk of damage during a flood similar to that of .	
In his  book "Beyond the  Generation," former EDD Chief Engineer   voiced his concerns about large-scale development near the levees, which separate the  water conservation areas from the  metropolitan area.	
 wrote, “It is my opinion...that anytime that area gets a foot or more of rainfall overnight, the shades of ’s flood will be with them again.”	

Following the phonetic alphabet from   , the    office in , , which then worked in conjunction with the military, named the storm "King," though such names were apparently informal and did not appear in public advisories until , when the   storm to be so designated was Hurricane Fox.	

Hurricane  was  monitored as an area of low pressure over    on   .	
Steadily tracking westward, the system was quickly classified as a depression before moving into the   near , , on  .	
Shortly thereafter, weather agencies lost track of the system over water due to a lack of ships in the region.	
However, later analysis determined that the cyclone obtained tropical storm status, with maximum sustained winds of  mph ( km/h), during the afternoon of  .	
The storm quickly intensified as it tracked nearly due west, attaining winds of  mph ( km/h), equivalent to a Category  hurricane on the – Hurricane Scale, roughly 8  after being classified a tropical storm.	
The hurricane maintained this intensity for   , taking a southwest turn on          , when  steamship "Arakaka" provided confirmation of its existence.	
Beginning then, the cyclone began to intensify more rapidly as its forward speed increased; between   and , reconnaissance missions by the    began monitoring the hurricane.	
At  UTC on  , a navy aircraft  penetrated the storm; in    , the storm strengthened, with another mission registering a barometric pressure of  mb ( inHg), a drop of  mb in  .	
On  , another airplane at  UTC confirmed that the storm had deepened further to  mb ( inHg) and its eye shrunk to ;  by that time the hurricane had reached Category  intensity.	
The same mission reported a double eyewall,  a feature replaced by a large eye by the time the storm hit the  and .	
  , the storm attained the minimum pressure,  mb ( inHg), recorded by aircraft reconnaissance during its life span, yet continued to intensify thereafter.	
Early on  , as its movement slowed greatly and turned westward near the northern , it attained its peak intensity of 0 mph ( km/h).	
Following the phonetic alphabet from   ,  the    office in , , which then worked in conjunction with the military, named the storm , though such names were apparently informal and did not appear in public advisories until , when the   storm to be so designated was Hurricane Fox.	

While retaining its intensity, the storm, its northwesterly course having been blocked by a ridge of high pressure, crossed the northern portion of the  , where on Elbow Cay the   weather station simultaneously estimated winds of  mph ( km/h) and recorded  mb ( inHg)  as the center passed just to the north.	
    on  , it made landfall near  , , as a strong Category  hurricane with maximum sustained winds near  mph ( km/h)—only  or hurricanes, all Category  ( 193   hurricane, , and ), are estimated to have had higher maximum sustained winds upon striking   .	
To this date, the hurricane remains the only major hurricane to have struck  , , at that strength, and the only  to pass directly over the county seat of  ,  though the   hurricane and Hurricane King caused significant damage in the county.

On  , concerns about disastrous flooding were heightened by memories of the   hurricane on the south shore and of the   hurricane at  .	
During the storm, tides peaked at  on the north shore of the lake  and  on the south shore at  and  , nearly overrunning the    that surrounded the lake.	
However, due to revamped improvements in the dike, the storm caused only minor damage, and the dike prevented a repeat of the flooding of  and , in which over  people drowned.	
Nevertheless, floodwaters in the  region resulted in significant losses to cattle, and hundreds of small block homes in the agricultural districts were blown off their foundations.	
Much of the marshy country was waterlogged during and after the storm.	

On the east coast of , many cities experienced significant flooding; tides of up to  affected  and   counties, washing out large portions of State Highway A1A between   and  , as well as between    and .
