338_chicago chicago , a large futures exchange, stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on   were concerned, its investigation found no evidence that high-frequency trading played a role, and in fact concluded that automated trading had contributed to market stability during the period of the crash.
339_chicago chicago Others speculate that an intermarket sweep order may have played a role in triggering the crash.
340_chicago chicago #"The fat-finger theory:" "Disproved."
341_chicago chicago In the immediate aftermath of the plunge, several reports indicated that the event may have been triggered by a fat-finger trade, an inadvertent large "sell order" for    stock, inciting massive algorithmic trading orders to dump the stock; however, this theory was quickly disproved after it was determined that   's decline occurred after a significant decline in the E-mini SP  Futures contracts.
342_chicago chicago The "fat-finger trade" hypothesis was also disproved when it was determined that existing   and ICE safeguards would have prevented such an error.
343_chicago chicago , the fat-finger theory is not considered credible.
344_chicago chicago #"Impact of High Frequency traders:" "Regulators found HFT's exacerbated price declines."
345_chicago chicago As noted above, regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines.
346_chicago chicago Regulators determined that high frequency traders sold aggressively to eliminate their positions and withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.
347_chicago chicago A   report by the      () an international body  securities regulators concluded that while "algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk their usage was also clearly a contributing factor in the flash crash event    ."
348_chicago chicago Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) was the underlying cause of the flash crash.
349_chicago chicago hypothesis based on the analysis of bid-offer data by   is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-offer spread) to exchanges in batches.
350_chicago chicago Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.
351_chicago chicago However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.
352_chicago chicago Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on  .
353_chicago chicago On    the regulators probing the crash concluded: "that quote-stuffing – placing and then almost immediately cancelling large numbers of rapid-fire orders to buy or sell stocks – was not a “major factor” in the turmoil."
354_chicago chicago Some have put forth the theory  trading actually have been a major factor in minimizing and reversing the flash crash.
355_chicago chicago #"Large directional bets:" "Regulators say a large E-Mini   seller set off a chain of events triggering the Flash Crash, but did not identify the firm."
356_chicago chicago Earlier, some investigators suggested that a large purchase of put options on the   index by the hedge fund   shortly before the crash may have been among the primary causes.
357_chicago chicago Other reports have speculated that the event may have been triggered by a single sale of  E-mini   contracts valued at around $4 billion by the  ,  firm    on the   .
358_chicago chicago Others suspect a movement in the  Dollar to   exchange rate.
359_chicago chicago #"Changes in market structure:" Some market structure experts speculate that, whatever the underlying causes, equity markets are vulnerable to these sort of events because of decentralization of trading.
360_chicago chicago #"Technical glitches:" An analysis of trading on the exchanges during the moments immediately prior to the flash crash reveals technical glitches in the reporting of prices on the  and various ATSs that might have contributed to the drying up of liquidity.
361_chicago chicago According to this theory, technical problems at the  led to delays as long as   in  quotes being reported on the Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) with time stamps indicating that the quotes were .
362_chicago chicago However, some market participants (those with access to 's own quote reporting system, OpenBook) could see both correct   quotes, as well as the delayed but apparently  CQS quotes.
363_chicago chicago At the same time, there were errors in the prices of some stocks ( , , and some ETFs).
364_chicago chicago Confused and uncertain about prices, many market participants attempted to drop out of the market by posting stub quotes (very low bids and very high offers) and, at the same time, many high-frequency trading algorithms attempted to exit the market with market orders (which were executed at the stub quotes) leading to a domino effect that resulted in the flash crash plunge.
