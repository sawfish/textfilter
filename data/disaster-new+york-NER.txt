439_new+york new+york Freshwater flooding was minimal, however, as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals, with only a few small areas receiving over  inches ( mm).
440_new+york new+york spanning  to  saw much demographic change in the  as large influxes of  immigrants settled in cities and towns throughout   and  , many of whom knew little, if anything, about hurricanes.
441_new+york new+york Most people at the time associated hurricanes with the warmer tropical regions off the   and southern   waters off the  coastline, and not the colder  waters off   and  .
442_new+york new+york The only tropical storms to affect the area in   had been weak remnant storms.
443_new+york new+york A more common weather phenomenon was a noreaster, which is a powerful low-pressure storm common in the Northeast during  and .
444_new+york new+york Although Noreasters can produce winds that are similar to those in hurricanes, they do not produce the storm surge that proved to be the  storm's greatest killer.
445_new+york new+york By , most of the earlier storms were hardly remembered.
446_new+york new+york The storm was  spotted south of the    on  .
447_new+york new+york Over    , it steadily gared strength and slowly tracked to  west-northwest.
448_new+york new+york By  , while centered east of the , the hurricane is estimated to have reached Category  intensity.
449_new+york new+york In response to a deep trough over , the hurricane veered northward, sparing the , , the , and the .
450_new+york new+york At the same time, a high pressure system was centered north of , preventing the hurricane from making an eastward turn out to sea.
451_new+york new+york Thus, the hurricane was effectively squeezed to the north between the  weather systems.
452_new+york new+york This conclusion was not reached merely with the wisdom of hindsight.
453_new+york new+york As described by  , pressor  physical sciences,     , in an article on this hurricane, there was a lone voice in the wilderness  the   meteorological fices crying out a warning  hurricane for  .
454_new+york new+york In Professor 's words, " , a young research forecaster for the  concluded that the storm would not continue to move northeast and curve out to sea but would instead track due north.
455_new+york new+york He was overruled by more senior meteorologists and the official forecast was for cloudy skies and gusty conditions – but no hurricane (, ).
456_new+york new+york Becuse the officil forecst ws not cuse for lrm, even s the winds picked up speed nd the wves rolled in, nobody relized tht  ctstrophe ws only    wy."
457_new+york new+york Late on  , this set-up caused the storm's forward speed to increase substantially.
458_new+york new+york In fact, the forward speed of the hurricane would ultimately reach  mph, the highest forward velocity ever recorded in the annals of hurricanes.
459_new+york new+york This extreme forward motion, being in the same general direction as the winds on the eastern side of the storm as it proceeded north, caused the perceived wind speed in areas east of the eye to be far higher than would be the case with a hurricane of more typical forward speed.
460_new+york new+york (Winds rotate counter-clockwise around all low pressure systems in the Northern hemisphere, thus winds on the right side of a hurricane--"right" being relative to the direction of motion of the storm itself—are moving in the same general direction as the hurricane.
461_new+york new+york Therefore, the forward motion increases the observed wind speed for points to the right of the eye of the hurricane and decreases the observed wind speed for points to the left of the eye, but in a complex way that defies crude addition or subtraction of the forward motion from the "intrinsic" wind speed of the hurricane.)
