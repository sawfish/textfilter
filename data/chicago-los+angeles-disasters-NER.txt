338_chicago chicago , a large futures exchange, stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on   were concerned, its investigation found no evidence that high-frequency trading played a role, and in fact concluded that automated trading had contributed to market stability during the period of the crash.
339_chicago chicago Others speculate that an intermarket sweep order may have played a role in triggering the crash.
340_chicago chicago #"The fat-finger theory:" "Disproved."
341_chicago chicago In the immediate aftermath of the plunge, several reports indicated that the event may have been triggered by a fat-finger trade, an inadvertent large "sell order" for    stock, inciting massive algorithmic trading orders to dump the stock; however, this theory was quickly disproved after it was determined that   's decline occurred after a significant decline in the E-mini SP  Futures contracts.
342_chicago chicago The "fat-finger trade" hypothesis was also disproved when it was determined that existing   and ICE safeguards would have prevented such an error.
343_chicago chicago , the fat-finger theory is not considered credible.
344_chicago chicago #"Impact of High Frequency traders:" "Regulators found HFT's exacerbated price declines."
345_chicago chicago As noted above, regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines.
346_chicago chicago Regulators determined that high frequency traders sold aggressively to eliminate their positions and withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.
347_chicago chicago A   report by the      () an international body  securities regulators concluded that while "algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk their usage was also clearly a contributing factor in the flash crash event    ."
348_chicago chicago Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) was the underlying cause of the flash crash.
349_chicago chicago hypothesis based on the analysis of bid-offer data by   is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-offer spread) to exchanges in batches.
350_chicago chicago Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.
351_chicago chicago However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.
352_chicago chicago Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on  .
353_chicago chicago On    the regulators probing the crash concluded: "that quote-stuffing – placing and then almost immediately cancelling large numbers of rapid-fire orders to buy or sell stocks – was not a “major factor” in the turmoil."
354_chicago chicago Some have put forth the theory  trading actually have been a major factor in minimizing and reversing the flash crash.
355_chicago chicago #"Large directional bets:" "Regulators say a large E-Mini   seller set off a chain of events triggering the Flash Crash, but did not identify the firm."
356_chicago chicago Earlier, some investigators suggested that a large purchase of put options on the   index by the hedge fund   shortly before the crash may have been among the primary causes.
357_chicago chicago Other reports have speculated that the event may have been triggered by a single sale of  E-mini   contracts valued at around $4 billion by the  ,  firm    on the   .
358_chicago chicago Others suspect a movement in the  Dollar to   exchange rate.
359_chicago chicago #"Changes in market structure:" Some market structure experts speculate that, whatever the underlying causes, equity markets are vulnerable to these sort of events because of decentralization of trading.
360_chicago chicago #"Technical glitches:" An analysis of trading on the exchanges during the moments immediately prior to the flash crash reveals technical glitches in the reporting of prices on the  and various ATSs that might have contributed to the drying up of liquidity.
361_chicago chicago According to this theory, technical problems at the  led to delays as long as   in  quotes being reported on the Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) with time stamps indicating that the quotes were .
362_chicago chicago However, some market participants (those with access to 's own quote reporting system, OpenBook) could see both correct   quotes, as well as the delayed but apparently  CQS quotes.
363_chicago chicago At the same time, there were errors in the prices of some stocks ( , , and some ETFs).
364_chicago chicago Confused and uncertain about prices, many market participants attempted to drop out of the market by posting stub quotes (very low bids and very high offers) and, at the same time, many high-frequency trading algorithms attempted to exit the market with market orders (which were executed at the stub quotes) leading to a domino effect that resulted in the flash crash plunge.

204_los+angeles los+angeles The Camry's braking distances with a purposely stuck accelerator were also shorter than that of the  ' regular stopping distance.
205_los+angeles los+angeles "Car and Driver" concluded that, based on their emergency stopping tests, the Camry's brakes could overcome the accelerator in all cases even without a brake override, and that stopping distances with a wide-open throttle were largely indiscernible from regular braking.

208_los+angeles los+angeles alleged that the problem was not with the accelerator pedals, but with the electronic throttle control systems (ETC).
209_los+angeles los+angeles An electronic throttle control system is a drive-by-wire system, in which the accelerator pedal and the engine are indirectly linked electronically, instead of directly linked mechanically.
210_los+angeles los+angeles This means that input from the accelerator pedal is just  input used to decide how wide the throttle is opened.
211_los+angeles los+angeles On    "The Wall Street Journal" reported that 's company was "controversial" because its income comes from lawsuits against auto manufacturers which was not disclosed in media reports; auto journalists noted that the firm had a "vested interest" in blaming manufacturer defects while avoiding operator error.
212_los+angeles los+angeles The "Los Angeles Times" reported that since  and Lexus began installing electronic throttle control systems in , complaints of unintended acceleration with vehicles from both those brands rose sharply.
213_los+angeles los+angeles Electromagnetic interference with the electronic throttle control system is another possible cause of unintended acceleration.
214_los+angeles los+angeles Some speculated that cosmic rays, or radiation from outer space, was a possible source for alleged electronic malfunctions.
215_los+angeles los+angeles The "Wall Street Journal" reported on    that "safety regulators human-error experts and auto makers say driver error is the primary cause of sudden acceleration."
216_los+angeles los+angeles Regarding the   recalls, "'s Auto" noted that  investigations over   have found that the majority of sudden unintended acceleration cases are due to driver error.
217_los+angeles los+angeles In such cases, accidents are the result of drivers mistakenly stepping on the gas pedal instead of the brake.
218_los+angeles los+angeles On    the "Los Angeles Times" quoted a motor skills consultant stating that the fault in sudden acceleration cases "almost always lies with drivers who step on the wrong pedal."
219_los+angeles los+angeles In  , "Car and Driver" suggested that the alleged accident rate of  in  recalled Toyotas was "highly unlikely" to result from vehicle defects, pointing to an increased danger for drivers who "aren't smart or calm enough to shift to neutral".
220_los+angeles los+angeles , "Forbes" referred to auto industry experts as "skeptical" of defect explanations, suggesting that "driver error and panic account for many reported problems" with recalled Toyotas.
221_los+angeles los+angeles On  ,  , author of "Traffic Safety", claimed that driver behavior was the main factor in Toyota accidents, and that the consensus of   of scientific research is that driver error is the prominent explanation for automotive fatalities.
222_los+angeles los+angeles In  , "Forbes"  , "The "s   and attorney   argued that the fact that most of the incidents of sudden acceleration in  occur in elderly drivers strongly suggest that there is not an electronics problem as opposed to  of pedal misapplication.
223_los+angeles los+angeles 's article was titled: "Why Do Toyotas Hate the Elderly?", and  noted that  immigrants were also twice as likely to be involved.
224_los+angeles los+angeles However, lawsuits filed regarding sudden unintended acceleration cases, along with related third-party investigation reports, have typically avoided the driver error explanation.

226_los+angeles los+angeles pointed to several factors that make driver error more likely: elderly driver age, lack of experience with the car, and short stature.
227_los+angeles los+angeles In addition, unexplained sudden acceleration events were most frequently reported as occurring from low speed or fully stopped.
228_los+angeles los+angeles Typically, the driver was intending to press the brake, and did not consciously confuse the pedals; however, because of advanced age and neuromuscular irregularities, short stature and difficulty reaching the pedals, a slight misalignment in seating position, or unfamiliarity with the car model, the driver's foot contacted the accelerator by mistake.
229_los+angeles los+angeles The resulting unexpected sudden acceleration would lead to panic, with the driver thinking that the acceleration system had failed.
230_los+angeles los+angeles The immediate response would be to brake hard, but not knowing that their foot was on the accelerator, pressing down caused greater acceleration.
231_los+angeles los+angeles In such panic situations, the driver would think that the brakes were not responding, and continue pressing on the gas pedal until they crashed.
232_los+angeles los+angeles Switching to neutral or turning off the ignition was typically not contemplated.
233_los+angeles los+angeles Incidents occurred exclusively in automatic transmission-equipped cars  with driver complaints involving rental cars being far more frequent.

305_los+angeles los+angeles In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the  clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally.
306_los+angeles los+angeles The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds.

320_los+angeles los+angeles It is necessary to mention that   statistics are computed for typical travels for respective forms of transport, so they cannot be used directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel "from A to B".
321_los+angeles los+angeles For example: according to statistics, a typical flight from   to   will carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office.

336_los+angeles los+angeles According to the "Washington Post", the "severe" limitations this imposed on state funding forced local governments and most school districts in  to make "drastic cutbacks".
337_los+angeles los+angeles Furthermore, an article in the "Los Angeles Times" noted that Federal aid money for  schools, worth about $98 million each year, may be reduced if state-funded programs are cut.
338_los+angeles los+angeles A recent  report had found that Proposition  would not result in any major "local spending" cuts.
339_los+angeles los+angeles In order to receive Federal aid, the state needed to maintain  levels of spending on local programs or secure local matching funds.
