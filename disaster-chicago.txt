"The great fire" of Portland, Maine occurred on July 4, 1866—the first Independence Day after the end of the American Civil War.
Five years before the Great Chicago Fire, this was the greatest fire yet seen in an American city.
It started in a boat house on Commercial Street, likely caused by a firecracker or a cigar ash.
The fire spread to a lumber yard and on to a sugar house, then spread across the city, eventually burning out on Munjoy Hill in the city's east end.
Only two people died in the fire but 10,000 were made homeless and 1,800 buildings were burned to the ground.
This included the federal Exchange Building by which was replaced with the custom house.
Soon after the fire, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow described his old home town: "Desolation!
Desolation!
Desolation!
It reminds me of Pompeii, the 'sepult city'."

Michigan closed its 1894 season with a trip to Chicago to face Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons.
Two hours before kickoff a "driving sleet storm" hit the city, and when the players lined up "the grounds were better fitted for skating rink purposes rather than a gridiron."
Despite the inclement weather, a large crowd turned out to watch the game.
According to a newspaper account, "the grand stand and outfield were packed with yelling collegians, and the boxes and carriage rooms were well filled with society people."
An account published in the "Detroit Free Press" described the atmosphere surrounding the game:"Notwithstanding the threatening weather, fully 6,000 of Chicago's best and fairest witnessed the hardest fought battle ever seen in Chicago. . . .
Michigan was not entirely over her hard-fought game in Detroit last Saturday and her men did not play with the snap and dash she displayed against Cornell.
The east and south sides of the field were lined with tally-hos, landaus, etc.
Everyone wore the colors of one of the colleges.
The yellow and blue of Michigan was as prominently displayed as was the maroon of Chicago.
Everyone was out to yell for his respective team and from the noise it seemed as if pandemonium had been turned loose."

There were 10 days of temperatures above  with 90 percent humidity.
The temperatures did not drop at night.
It caused more deaths than the 1863 New York City draft riots or the 1871 Great Chicago Fire.

With Curtis out of action, the Penn team focused on John Garrels.
Early in the game, Michigan kept the ball in Penn territory, and Garrels narrowly missed a field goal from the 45-yard line.
Also early in the first half, Penn's right tackle Gaston shoved Garrels to the ground after he had punted.
The blow nearly knocked Garrels out of the game, and the head linesman called a penalty of 30 yards and ejected Gaston from the game.
The "Chicago Daily Tribune" wrote that "Gaston slugged Garrels, knocking the big acting captain 'silly' for a few minutes and dazing him for the entire half."
After the game, Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick noted that "Garrels' face is badly disfigured for the time being."
The "Tribune" also reported that Penn's fullback Hollenbach had kneed Michigan halfback Paul Magoffin in the face.

Just before the noon hour, severe thunderstorms began forming  west of downtown Chicago.
The first storm started to spawn killer tornadoes in DeKalb and then Kane Counties starting at 12:00 pm.
Roughly 15 minutes later a violent F4 tornado tore through Will and Cook Counties cutting a path  long in the Bellwood and Maywood areas that would kill 20 people as the storm devastated the community of Melrose Park.
Ten of the fatalities occurred when the storm made a direct hit on the Melrose Park Catholic Church and Convent where people were getting ready for Palm Sunday services.
Six more people would be killed in the community of Dunning before the storm passed into Lake Michigan.

Severe thunderstorms began developing in Missouri during the early morning hours.
The storms moved quickly to the northeast towards Chicago, Illinois.
The first tornado injured five people  southeast of Springfield, Missouri in the pre-dawn hours in Douglas County.
This first twister was a harbinger of things to come as the morning went on and the atmosphere began to destabilize, due to the abundance of sunshine that preceded the cold front in the warm sector, which covered the lower Great Lakes region extending southward well past the Ohio River Valley.

Weather forecasters and the public alike in the Chicago, Dayton, Fort Wayne, Lansing, South Bend, and Toledo areas were unaware that the stage was set that day for a tragic tornado outbreak that would follow on a balmy and seemingly tranquil Palm Sunday afternoon.
The weather maps in use in 1920 showed a rather large and deep cyclone over northern Iowa that was forecast to move across central Lower Michigan by nightfall with a trailing cold front.
Meteorologists knew rain showers and perhaps a thundershower was a good possibility, but were unaware that the helicity, lifted index, and upper level winds were being guided by a strong jet stream with a probable negative-tilt that would create favorable conditions for the development of tornadoes.

As the Palm Sunday storms swept quickly out of the Chicago area across Lake Michigan, they moved towards Michigan's Lower Peninsula.
Fourteen tornadoes (highest number of any state reported) would cause massive destruction across the region from Berrien and Mason Counties starting at 12:30 pm, moving northeastward to the Kalamazoo, Lansing, Flint and Saginaw areas, ending after 8:00 pm.

1. Harry Frieda, Chicago –  193 feet, 6 inches  2. Priester, Mississippi A&M – 189 feet, 9½ inches  3. Welchel, Georgia Tech – 187 feet, 9 inches  4. Schjoll, Minnesota – 184 feet, 8½ inches 5. Hartley, Nebraska – 178 feet, 3 inches

Although the official paid attendance was recorded as 40,000, newspaper accounts reported that only 20,000 actually attended, as the game was played in a heavy rainstorm on a cold afternoon.
The rain turned the field into a "sea of mud" with an inch of standing water on top of the mud.
In the "Chicago Daily Tribune", Walter Eckersall (who also served as the game's referee) compared the field to a "bog" and added:"In my twenty-five years of football I have never seen worse conditions.
Pools of water stood on parts of the field and in some places the players' feet sunk into the field five or six inches.
It rained throughout the game and a strong wind from the north gave the team defending that goal a decided advantage."
The conditions on the field were so poor that the schools' marching bands declined the usual halftime parade across the field and instead played from the cinder path around the field.

Melvin Purvis, head of the Chicago office of the United States Bureau of Investigation described the damage: "Our investigation convinced me that the tragedy resulted from an explosion somewhere in the region of the baggage compartment in the rear of the plane.
Everything in front of the compartment was blown forward, everything behind blown backward, and things at the side outward."
He also noted: "The gasoline tanks, instead of being blown out, were crushed in, showing there was no explosion in them."

As many as 5,000 heat related deaths were reported in the United States, and 780 direct and 400 indirect deaths in Canada.
Many people suffered from heat stroke and heat exhaustion, particularly the elderly.
Unlike today, air conditioning was in the early stages of development and was therefore absent from houses and commercial buildings.
Many of the deaths occurred in high population density areas of Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Toronto and other urban areas.
Farmers across the continent saw crop failure, causing corn and wheat prices to rise quickly.
Droughts and heat waves were common in the 1930s.
The 1930s are remembered as the driest and warmest decade for the US (the Dust Bowl years) and the summer of 1936 was the most widespread and destructive heat wave to occur in the Americas in centuries.

The Canadiens went from last to first in the Canadian Division.
Morenz was just hitting his stride in January 1937, when tragedy struck.
On one of his hurtling rushes, he was being checked by Earl Seibert of Chicago when his left skate got caught in the dasher of the end boards, and Morenz suffered a badly fractured leg.
After suffering a nervous breakdown worrying about if he'd be able to come back, more bad luck occurred.
On March 8, 1937, X-rays revealed that Howie had blood clots in his healing leg.
An operation was scheduled for the next day, but when Howie ate a light supper and told the nurse he wanted to rest, in falling asleep his pallor suddenly changed and the nurse knew something was wrong.
A blood clot had stopped his heart, and attempts to revive Howie failed.
News of Morenz's death shocked the hockey world, and thousands filed past his bier, many in tears, to pay their last respects.

On November 16, 1936, Hal Winkler made his NHL debut for the New York Rangers and gained a 1-0 shutout over the Montreal Maroons.
He was the first goaltender to have a shutout in his NHL debut.
The Montreal Canadiens had hit the bottom in 1935–36, and Babe Siebert was obtained to shore up the defence.
But the most loved of all movements was buying Howie Morenz back from the Rangers.

On September 27, a tropical storm formed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean just off the coast of Guatemala.
It drifted northwestward, and made landfall on Guatemala on September 28.
It moved northward along the western border of Guatemala, and after crossing southeastern Mexico the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on October 1.
As it traversed northwestward it strengthened, and became a hurricane on October 2. It turned more to the north and intensified to a major hurricane on October 3 as it neared the Texas coastline.
It rapidly attained peak winds of 135 mph (205 km/h).
Subsequently, the made landfall near Freeport, Texas on October 4 as a Category 4 hurricane.
The lowest recorded pressure was 978 mbar, and estimates place the minimum central pressure near 972 mbar.
The hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it turned northeastward over land, though it maintained tropical storm status until October 6 while over Missouri.
As a tropical depression it accelerated northeastward, and later that day it dissipated near Chicago, Illinois.

The storm moved ashore near Freeport during the night of October 3, and after significantly weakening, it passed directly over Houston; the next storm to do so would be Hurricane Alicia in 1983.
Upon moving inland, the hurricane quickly deteriorated, and is estimated to have downgraded into a tropical storm within six hours of making landfall.
It turned northeastward as it continued through the central United States, weakening to a tropical depression by October 6.
It persisted until October 8, when it is believed to have dissipated near Chicago, Illinois.

At 5:30 P.M., another strong, later F4-estimated, tornado touched down near Palos Hills.
Near the beginning of its path, the tornado downed multiple trees and two high transmission electrical towers.
It strengthened and in the space of six minutes, tore a 16.2-mile (65 mph ground speed) swath of destruction through Oak Lawn, Hometown, Evergreen Park, and devastated the south side of Chicago before moving offshore to Lake Michigan as people were stuck in traffic during Friday rush hour.
Many of the deaths occurred at traffic lights, where vehicles were thrown by the tornado.
For that reason, this tornado ended up being the deadliest in the outbreak.
Thirty-three people were killed and 1000 were injured, including 16 deaths alone at the intersection of Southwest Highway and W. 95th St. (US-12/20) in Oak Lawn.
Several children were killed when a roller skating rink was struck.
A high school, grocery store, tavern, market, motel, drive-in theater, restaurant, numerous apartments, and two gas stations were destroyed as well.
A mobile home court was also destroyed and a large brick factory structure was damaged as well.
It destroyed 152 homes and damaged 900, causing $50 million in damage.

The next day thunderstorms produced sleet, freezing rain, and snow in St. Louis.
Three days later, on January 27, a blizzard crippled Chicago, dumping  of snow on the city.

The earthquake was felt in 23 states and affected a zone of .
The shaking extended east to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, south to Mississippi and Alabama, north to Toronto, Canada, and west to Oklahoma.
Isolated reports were received from Boston, Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola, Florida, southern Ontario, Arkansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, presumably because of shaking.
The worst affected areas were in the general area of Evansville, Indiana, St. Louis, and Chicago, but there was no major damage.
There were no deaths; the worst injury was a child knocked unconscious by falling debris outside his home.

Due to the foggy conditions and limited visibility at the airport, it took controllers nearly two minutes to determine that something had happened to North Central Flight 575.
Once they did, they alerted the Chicago Fire Department, which arrived at the scene about a minute later, three minutes after the crash.
Employing 11 crash and fire vehicles and two ambulances, the fire department extinguished the fire in about 16 minutes at around 6:19 p.m. CDT.

Widespread significantly severe damaging wind occurred in many areas across eastern Iowa and the northwestern third of Illinois.
Many corn fields were flattened and trees were downed, and light structural damage occurred.
Power was cut to thousands across the western and northwestern suburbs of Chicago.
Around 5:05 pm, a rope-like tornado with multiple funnels was sighted on a farm southwest of Toulon, Illinois, following a left-curving path, before lifting  south of Toulon, leaving crop damage and was rated F0 with a path length of  and width of .
A wind gust of  was measured near Peoria and a funnel cloud was spotted at Groveland.
Lightning also damaged several houses and buildings.
One woman was killed when venturing outside to close her car windows and a six-story International Harvester warehouse was ignited into a large fire.

The first tornado of a complex combination of tornado family and extreme downbursts touched down at 4:30 p.m. about  west of the small city of Canton (or  southwest of Blyton) and immediately grew to very large size in agrarian central Fulton County.
It continued meandering rural areas with an average movement of easterly roughly near Illinois Route 9 for  before ending about  southeast of Fiatt.
A grain elevator was leveled and blown about  away.
Total damages were around $250,000.
A University of Chicago team headed by Ted Fujita surveyed the damage path as  wide at times and suction spot crop damage indicated a multiple vortex tornado.

The nursing home was equipped with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department.
The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated.
The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one fire alarm box located at the entrance of the building.
The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet.
The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors.
On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.

The "1976 Wincrest Nursing Home fire" took place on Friday, January 30, 1976 in Chicago, USA.
The fire occurred when an arsonist set a wardrobe closet on fire at the Wincrest Nursing Home building, located at 6326 N. Winthrop Avenue.
The alarm sounded at 11:30 a.m. and the fire was put out at 1:30 p.m.
Although the building itself sustained minor smoke, fire and water damage, 23 people died from smoke inhalation.
A 21 year old housekeeper was arrested by authorities and was charged with multiple counts of arson.

The fire was put out at 1:28 p.m. CDT.
The room where the fire broke out was completely gutted and the adjacent corridor sustained only moderate smoke and heat damage.
Three other rooms also suffered heat and smoke damage.
No smoke damage was evident on the second or first floors and water damage was minor.
However despite the minor damage to the building, 23 fatalities were reported due to smoke inhalation.
An investigation made by the Chicago Police Department and fire department.
The survivors claimed that the fire was started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time.
Although the actual cause of the fire was unknown, the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson.
It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the fire was an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the fire were never noted.

At the time of the fire, the building was occupied by 83 residents, three nurses, 2 aides and eleven office, kitchen and maintenance staff.
28 of the residents were in the chapel room on the third floor of the building.
Fire was reported in room 306 by a nurse’s aide who pulled the fire alarm box.
The alarm was received by the Chicago Fire Department at 11:43 A.M (CDT).
Attempts to put out the fire by staff proved to no avail.
The first fire engine arrived at the scene of the fire 3 minutes and 40 seconds later as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building.
More fire engines arrived seconds later as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building.
At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the third floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs.
The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals.

The "1977 Chicago Loop derailment" occurred on February 4, 1977, when a Chicago Transit Authority elevated train rear-ended another on the northeast corner of the Loop at Wabash Avenue and Lake Street during the evening rush hour.
The collision forced the first four cars of the rear train off the elevated tracks, killing eleven people and injuring over 180 as the cars fell onto the street below.
It remains the single worst accident in the agency's history.

According to the Chicago Tribune, NWS Chicago had "the worst record in the nation" for issuing warnings for severe storms, only issuing warnings 24% of the time when a warning was justifiable.
Even today, many meteorologists refer to the "Plainfield Syndrome" as the idea that it's better to issue too many warnings and be wrong than to miss one critical warning, as was the case for the Plainfield Tornado.
At some point after the 1990 tornado, the National Weather Service reduced the Chicago office's workload by creating an office in Romeoville, Illinois and allowing offices in the Quad Cities, St. Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana and Paducah, Kentucky to issue forecasts for their respective areas.

The "1990 Plainfield tornado" was a devastating tornado that occurred on the afternoon of Tuesday, August 28, 1990.
The violent tornado killed 29 people and injured 353.
It is the only F5 tornado ever recorded in August and the only F5 tornado to ever strike the Chicago area.
There are few known videos or photographs of the tornado.

Conditions were ripe for severe thunderstorm development, and with both low level and high level steering winds from the west-northwest, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center issued a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for northern Illinois valid 1:30 p.m. through 8:00 p.m. CDT that night.
The NSSFC predicted a derecho-type event for later that night as rapidly developing thunderstorms along a cold front in Wisconsin would be carried by the steering flow into the Chicago area.
One of these storms developed supercellular characteristics south of Rockford, steering 30 to 40 degrees to the right of prevailing steering winds.
By now, mid-level steering winds had begun to veer, causing a wind profile slightly more favorable for tornadic development.
This helped develop a high precipitation supercell.

In the months following the tornado, the National Weather Service was heavily criticized for providing no warning of the approaching tornado.
The NOAA Disaster Survey Report was highly critical of the forecast process within the Chicago office as well as coordination with local spotter networks and the preparedness of these groups.
Prior to 1990, the National Weather Service in Chicago was responsible for providing forecasts for the entire state of Illinois.

As the Chicago office was overwhelmed with its workload, no warnings were issued by the office until 2:32 p.m. &mdash; nearly an hour after the first tornado was sighted southeast of Rockford.
A second severe thunderstorm warning was issued almost an hour later at 3:23 p.m., but this provided no indication that a tornado was on the ground and did not mention the area where the tornado had tracked.
No tornado warning was issued until after the tornado lifted.

In eastern Minnesota, the Halloween Blizzard shattered many of the previous October snowfall records.
The 8.2 inches that fell in the Twin Cities on October 31 was more snow than had ever been recorded in any October in its recorded history.
November 1 saw similar daily records fall, but with a more wide reaching area from most of central Minnesota eastward to La Crosse and Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
Following the storm Arctic air poured southward from Canada to produce many record low temperatures in these same areas.
Bismarck, North Dakota, sank to −10 °F on October 31, breaking their previous record low of  by 16 degrees.
Record snow and cold was recorded as far south as Nebraska and Colorado.
The Arctic air also spread over Chicago, recording a low of 11 on November 4.

The "1995 Chicago heat wave" was a heat wave which led to approximately 750 heat-related deaths in Chicago over a period of five days.
Eric Klinenberg, author of the 2002 book "Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago", has noted that in the United States, the loss of human life in hot spells in summer exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
The heat wave heavily impacted the wider Midwestern region, with additional deaths in both St. Louis, Missouri and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as well.

The temperatures soared to record highs in July with the hottest weather occurring from July 12 to July 16.
The high of  on July 13 was the second warmest July temperature (warmest being  set on July 23, 1934) since records began at Chicago Midway International Airport in 1928.
Nighttime low temperatures were unusually high; in the upper 70s and lower 80s °F (about 26 °C)&mdash;as well.
Record humidity levels also accompanied the hot weather.
The heat index reached  at O'Hare airport, and  at Midway Airport.

Impacts in the Chicago urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than .
Urban heat islands are caused by the concentration of buildings and pavement in urban areas, which tend to absorb more heat in the day and radiate less heat at night into their immediate surroundings than comparable rural sites.
Therefore, built-up areas get hotter and stay hotter.

Other aggravating factors were inadequate warnings, power failures, inadequate ambulance service and hospital facilities, and lack of preparation.
City officials did not release a heat emergency warning until the last day of the heat wave.
Thus, such emergency measures as Chicago's five cooling centers were not fully utilized.
The medical system of Chicago was severely taxed as thousands were taken to local hospitals with heat-related problems.

Another powerful factor in the heat wave was that a temperature inversion grew over the city, and air stagnated in this situation.
Pollutants and humidity were confined to ground level, and the air was becalmed and devoid of wind.
Without wind to stir the air, temperatures grew even hotter than could be expected with just an urban heat island, and without wind there was truly no relief.
Without any way to relieve the heat, even the inside of homes became ovens, with indoor temperature exceeding  at night.
This was especially noticeable in areas which experienced frequent power outages.
At Northwestern University just north of Chicago, summer school students lived in dormitories without air conditioning.
In order to ease the effects of the heat, some of the students slept at night with water-soaked towels as blankets.

About fifty people were on the top wooden balcony at the time of the collapse.
According to one witness, the sound of splintering wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time.
The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below.
The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them.
Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell.
Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others.
One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived.
The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort.
Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.

In 2005, the city of Chicago filed a negligence lawsuit against two of the survivors, William Fenton-Hathaway and John Koranda.
The city alleged that the  balcony collapse occurred after defendants Fenton-Hathaway and Koranda "intentionally and negligently" began jumping up and down on the porch.
Koranda's brother, Robert Koranda, was killed in the collapse.
The charges against Fenton-Hathaway and Koranda were later dropped.

On June 29, 2003, the deadliest porch collapse in United States history occurred in Chicago.
An overloaded balcony collapsed during a party in an apartment building, killing thirteen people and seriously injuring fifty-seven others.
The ensuing investigation was highly critical of the way the balcony was built, finding a large number of errors in its construction which ultimately resulted in the collapse.
However, the building's owner continues to blame overcrowding on the balcony for its complete structural failure, although he has taken steps to strengthen the balconies at his properties to prevent a recurrence of the disaster.
The accident resulted in sweeping inspections of  similar structures across Chicago, with 1,260 cases being actioned by the city authorities.

As the evacuating crowd pushed open the doors, several people already climbing the stairs were knocked down and subsequently pinned by the ensuing crush.
Security attempted to pull them to safety, but the pile rapidly reached six feet in height as a result of more than 1,500 simultaneously attempting to escape the chaos inside.
Ira Navarro, a former E2 guard who had worked at trying to free trapped patrons, recalled to the "Chicago Sun-Times" in January 2007 that he had heard other clubbers atop the stairs laughing at the fracas, unaware of the fatalities stemming from the ground-floor pileup.

On September 11 at Chicagoland Speedway, Dan Wheldon won his sixth race, breaking the all-time record for most wins in an IRL season.
Ryan Briscoe was involved in a fiery crash with Alex Barron on lap 20.
Briscoe was taken by helicopter to a Chicago-area hospital with head and back pain, but was alert.
He suffered a concussion, two broken collarbones, a bruised lung and contusions to his arms and legs.
The accident resulted in a 16-minute red flag.

Just north of Toronto at Buttonville Airport, the temperature reached 37.8 °C (100.4 °F) on August 2, 2006.
On the same day, the nighttime minimum temperature in Toronto was the highest ever recorded, only dropping to 27.2 °C (81 °F).
In Ottawa, the temperature reached 36.3 °C (97.5 °F), but with close to 80% humidity factored in, it reached an all-time humidex record of 48 °C (118 °F).http://www.ottawasun.com/News/OttawaAndRegion/2006/08/02/1714593-sun.html

Record power consumption was recorded in Ontario when close to 27,000 MW were used by consumers, beating out a record from the previous summer.

In the early August heat, Chicago saw at least 23 deaths, but the City was widely praised for avoiding the disaster that occurred in the 1995 Chicago heat wave which saw over 700 deaths.
The City took steps to ensure vulnerable residents were protected, and individuals took responsibility for their neighbors.

The city of Rockford, Illinois was deluged in the weeks preceding the major flooding during the third week of August.
On August 7, 2007, Rockford was hit by five to seven inches (127–178 mm) of rain.
Many streets, including main thoroughfares, were flooded.
There was also fear that the Alpine Dam might break.
The following day, Governor Rod Blagojevich declared both Rockford and Winnebago County a state disaster area.
With this declaration, he dispatched both the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to assist the city.
Debris removal, law enforcement, damage assessment, and other physical assistance were offered by the governor.
About two weeks later on August 23, violent storms rolled through the Chicago area.
A Tornado Warning was issued for all of Chicago during the first storm and a tornado touched down in Winfield.
The second storm was more rain and lightning.
Governor Rod Blagojevich declared McHenry, Lake, Cook (including Chicago), DuPage, and Kane counties to be disaster areas after the storm.
Though not affected by flooding as it was on August 7, the city of Rockford received 1.23 inches (31 mm) of rain, setting an all time record for Rockford's wettest month in recorded climate data history, with a total of 13.82 inches (351 mm) of rain.
The storm shut down airports (including O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport), uprooted trees and left over 600,000 residents in northern Illinois without power, some for several days.
[http://wmaq.weatherplus.com/weathernews/13960081/detail.html
NBC 5 News]  It also caused flooding on streets and major expressways shuch as the Bishop Ford Freeway.
Wind gusts registered as high as 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) in the area, with the highest being reported in Manhattan.
A small tornado was also reported in Bolingbrook in a DuPage County Forest Preserve.
Rainfall totals in Boone and LaSalle Counties topped 1987 records.
Flooding across northern Illinois was widespread in the aftermath of the storms.
Along the Rock River in Byron, the river reached moderate flood stage on August 24; moderate stage is above 14 feet (4 m).
Officials in Ogle County recommended that people in low-lying areas along the Rock River, and along Killbuck Creek near Lindenwood, evacuate to higher ground.
Downstream, in Lee County at Dixon, the river had not reached flood stage as off August 25, though it continued to rise.
Other rivers and streams in the Rock River valley experienced moderate to major flooding as well.
The Kishwaukee River at Perryville crested at 17.57 feet (5.36 m), more than five feet above flood stage.
The same river also rose above flood stage in Belvidere.
After 4.85 inches (123 mm) of rain fell on August 23 and 24 in DeKalb County, at DeKalb, the South Branch Kishwaukee River rose to its highest level since 1983 and its second highest level in recorded history.
Numerous roads and bridges were closed, and the cities of DeKalb and Sycamore declared local emergencies, though DeKalb County was not included in Blagojevich's initial disaster declaration.
DeKalb County received state disaster area designation from Blagojevich on August 26.
In DeKalb and Sycamore, about 600 residents were displaced from their homes, and the DeKalb campus of Northern Illinois University was closed because of the flood.
The Fox River at Dayton crested after it rose to more than 17 feet (5 m), over five feet above the river's flood stage.
In Plano, Illinois the Fox rose up around the historic Farnsworth House, a modern architecture masterpiece designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
Preservationists used a boat to save the home and its furnishings, which previously had been devastated by high water in 1996.
With the boat, preservationists were able to enter the house and move vulnerable furnishings to higher locations within the home.
Water rose to within a foot of the Farnsworth House's raised platform, covering the terrace in front of the home, but the river crested before any damage occurred.
At Starved Rock State Park, parking lots were closed due to the level of the Illinois River, which stood at 26.5 feet on August 25, 6.5 feet (2 m) above its flood stage.

As a consequence of Hurricane Ike damaging the Houston area, two games between the Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs were relocated to Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Although Milwaukee was picked as a "neutral" site whose retractable roof would ensure the game would be played in the event of inclement weather, Miller Park's location  from Chicago – and well over  from Houston – resulted in a decidedly pro-Cubs crowd in a series where Houston was officially designated as the home team.
Adding to the controversy from the Houston perspective was the fact that Turner Field in Atlanta had been suggested by the players' union as a potential neutral site.
This would mark the second time in as many years that a series was moved to neutral Miller Park due to weather, as a series between the Seattle Mariners and Cleveland Indians was relocated there one year earlier as a consequence of snow storms in northern Ohio.

Moisture from Lowell eventually joined with a cold front and the remnants of Hurricane Ike and caused significant damage.
As this conglomeration of moisture traveled through the United States it caused extensive flooding in Illinois.
In Chicago it broke flooding records dating back to 1871.

Southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, the area of thunderstorms strengthened into Tropical Storm Lowell on the night of September 6.
The system skipped tropical depression status and was named "Lowell".
Lowell slowly strengthened into a 50 mph Tropical Storm.
A tropical storm watch was issued for southern Baja California as the storm headed north, but it weakened to a tropical depression on September 9.
The next day Tropical Depression Lowell made landfall with 35 mph winds.
It moved inland and dissipated  on September 11.
The remnants of Tropical Storm Lowell continued across the United States and joined with a cold front bringing heavy rains to the central northern states before tracking into Canada.
It caused the heaviest rainstorm ever recorded in Chicago since records began in 1877.

Over 1,000 flight cancellations were reported at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, and numerous flight cancellations also occurred at Toronto's Pearson International Airport.
In Milwaukee, whiteout conditions and 13 inches (33 cm) of snow briefly shut down the General Mitchell International Airport.
Near Madison, Wisconsin, about 1,000 vehicles were stranded on Interstate 90 due to the snow.
Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle declared a state of emergency for the area and activated the Wisconsin National Guard.
On February 6, numerous schools, colleges, government buildings, churches, businesses, and shopping malls were forced to close throughout southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois due to the inclement weather.
The winter storm was responsible for at least four deaths: one each in Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Quebec.

April showers brought more bad weather and injuries to the club.
Michael Harrington joined Zusi as the most recently injured when he also went down in training with a hamstring strain.
The patchwork defense returned home for the first Sunday match of the season featuring rookie and 1st round pick Matt Besler in the back line against a then potent attacking SJ Earthquakes team.
For the second week in a row the club faced difficult weather conditions (freezing rain and wind gusts up to 40 MPH).
They responded with a better effort, shutting out the Quakes and securing their first win of the season 2-0.
Week 4 brought a trip to Seattle to face the undefeated expansion Sounders.
The Wizards controlled the first half despite not scoring and saw the Sounders go down a man in the 29th minute when goalkeeper Kasey Keller used his hands outside of the box to deflect a scoring chance from the fast breaking Herculez Gomez.
The Wizards couldn't capitalize in the first half and the Sounders looked the better side in the second half until Davy Arnaud launched a game-winning missile from 30 yards out in the 80th minute to deliver the first goal surrendered and first loss to Seattle.
The road trip continued onto the Eastern Conference leading Chicago Fire.
The Fire sharply outplayed the relatively sluggish Wizards for the entire first half and most of the second half, with Brian McBride scoring two early goals.
However goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made several spectacular saves to prevent Chicago from any further scoring, and the Wizards were able to muster a comeback late in the second half, with Josh Wolff scoring two goals of his own to equalize the match 2-2.
The Wizards welcomed New York to town for the first ever ESPN telecast from Community America Ballpark, Red Bull defender Carlos Johnson took Herculez Gomez down in the box just two minutes into the match and received a red card for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.
Neither team played particularly well following the ejection of Johnson but Kansas City got the three points as a result of Claudio López slotting the resulting penalty kick past newly reinstated Jon Conway, who had served the longest "performance-enhancing drug" suspension ever in Major League Soccer.
Jack Jewsbury didn't make the final road trip of April to Toronto as a result of the concussion he suffered just days earlier.
The Wizards missed their holding midfielder as TFC played their first match under interim manager Chris Cummins as John Carver stepped down.
Toronto was also missing star player Dwayne De Rosario (injured) but Danny Dichio's scramble goal in the 54th minute and TFC's clean sheet was enough to end the Wizards 18 regular season game streak of scoring at least one goal (second longest in the team history).
Curt Onalfo's April ended with his family being in a car wreck on the way to the final home game and him personally being fined for comments he made to the officials following the lost in Toronto which he explained was a result of having his passport stolen just days before the trip and having to fly to Colorado to secure a new one in person(The fine was paid for by the club's supporters group as a sign of respect for all he had been through).

Heavy rain in parts of the Midwest prompted the National Weather Service to issue Flood Warnings for many areas.
The max rainfall amount recorded so far is  in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Freezing rain fell across Iowa and Illinois, affecting travel to and from O'Hare International Airport.
The Chicago area saw as much as ten inches of snow following the freezing rain and sleet.

It was felt across most of Ontario and Quebec, as well as parts of the northeastern United States, in addition to places as far as Chicago, Baltimore, Charleston, West Virginia, and Halifax.
It was the first moderate earthquake associated with the Western Quebec Seismic Zone since 20 April 2002, when the area was affected by magnitude 5.1 Mw tremors.
Southern Ontario was also affected by the 1998 magnitude 5.2 Mw Pymatuning earthquake, associated with a different seismic region (Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone).

CME Group, a large futures exchange, stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on CME Group were concerned, its investigation found no evidence that high-frequency trading played a role, and in fact concluded that automated trading had contributed to market stability during the period of the crash.
Others speculate that an intermarket sweep order may have played a role in triggering the crash.
#"The fat-finger theory:" "Disproved."
In the immediate aftermath of the plunge, several reports indicated that the event may have been triggered by a fat-finger trade, an inadvertent large "sell order" for Procter & Gamble stock, inciting massive algorithmic trading orders to dump the stock; however, this theory was quickly disproved after it was determined that Procter and Gamble's decline occurred after a significant decline in the E-mini S&P 500 Futures contracts.
The "fat-finger trade" hypothesis was also disproved when it was determined that existing CME Group and ICE safeguards would have prevented such an error.
Currently, the fat-finger theory is not considered credible.
#"Impact of High Frequency traders:" "Regulators found HFT's exacerbated price declines."
As noted above, regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines.
Regulators determined that high frequency traders sold aggressively to eliminate their positions and withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.
A July, 2011 report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an international body of securities regulators, concluded that while "algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk, their usage was also clearly a contributing factor in the flash crash event of May 6, 2010."
Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) was the underlying cause of the flash crash.
One hypothesis, based on the analysis of bid-offer data by Nanex, Llc., is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-offer spread) to exchanges in batches.
Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.
However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.
Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on May 6.
On September 3, 2010 the regulators probing the crash concluded: "that quote-stuffing – placing and then almost immediately cancelling large numbers of rapid-fire orders to buy or sell stocks – was not a “major factor” in the turmoil."
Some have put forth the theory High-frequency trading actually have been a major factor in minimizing and reversing the flash crash.
#"Large directional bets:" "Regulators say a large E-Mini S&P 500 seller set off a chain of events triggering the Flash Crash, but did not identify the firm."
Earlier, some investigators suggested that a large purchase of put options on the S&P 500 index by the hedge fund Universa Investments shortly before the crash may have been among the primary causes.
Other reports have speculated that the event may have been triggered by a single sale of 75,000 E-mini S&P 500 contracts valued at around $4 billion by the Overland Park, Kansas firm Waddell & Reed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Others suspect a movement in the U.S. Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
#"Changes in market structure:" Some market structure experts speculate that, whatever the underlying causes, equity markets are vulnerable to these sort of events because of decentralization of trading.
#"Technical glitches:" An analysis of trading on the exchanges during the moments immediately prior to the flash crash reveals technical glitches in the reporting of prices on the NYSE and various ATSs that might have contributed to the drying up of liquidity.
According to this theory, technical problems at the NYSE led to delays as long as five minutes in NYSE quotes being reported on the Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) with time stamps indicating that the quotes were current.
However, some market participants (those with access to NYSE's own quote reporting system, OpenBook) could see both correct current NYSE quotes, as well as the delayed but apparently current CQS quotes.
At the same time, there were errors in the prices of some stocks (Apple Inc., Sothebys, and some ETFs).
Confused and uncertain about prices, many market participants attempted to drop out of the market by posting stub quotes (very low bids and very high offers) and, at the same time, many high-frequency trading algorithms attempted to exit the market with market orders (which were executed at the stub quotes) leading to a domino effect that resulted in the flash crash plunge.

Prior to Week 14, the inflatable roof of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, home of the Minnesota Vikings, buckled and tore as a result of heavy snowfall in Minneapolis, spilling snow onto Mall of America field and rendering the stadium unusable for the remainder of the Vikings' season.
The Vikings' scheduled home game against the New York Giants was moved to Detroit's Ford Field and postponed to a 7:20 pm EST kickoff on Monday.
Though stadium workers were initially "optimistic" that the roof could be repaired before the Vikings faced the Chicago Bears on December 20, stadium officials determined that such a repair would not be possible in that time frame and the game was moved to TCF Bank Stadium.

For the Midwest became more related to the extreme high humidity, above normal rainfall from thunderstorms across much of Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Illinois in the previous month leading up to the heat wave caused dew points to soar; in Newton, Iowa where temperatures had been in the mid-90s F, the dew point reached  on July 14, one of the highest ever recorded in the United States.
The heat index reached  in Newton, Chicago's dew point of , matching readings from the 1995 heat wave that caused many deaths.
Omaha, Des Moines and St. Louis also experienced high humidity levels.

Westboro Baptist Church planned on protesting the funerals of the dead.
The residents of the city were mortified and several local groups created a "Shield of support" around the funeral processions with thousands attending, standing in large groups around the city.
FEMA and IEMA began doing preliminary damage assessments on 5 March 2012 to determine the need for public assistance from FEMA.
The storm damage in Harrisburg dominated national airwaves for several days with both Anderson Cooper, and Diane Sawyer doing special reports.
Both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune wrote articles on the resilient history and nature of Harrisburg in the wake of the tornado and floods that have hit the city since its founding in 1889.
The tornado moved eastward before striking the town of Ridgway, where additional severe damage occurred.
In Ridgway, the tornado damaged about 140 homes and businesses, causing 1 critical injury and 12 minor injuries.
Numerous cars were tossed around, mainly on the east side of Ridgway.
A large church building and a half dozen grain bins were completely destroyed.
Final assessment rated the tornado as an EF4 with wind gusts estimated at

The "Punch A.J." campaign was inspired by an incident on May 20, 2006 between Pierzynski and Chicago Cubs catcher Michael Barrett.
After a fly ball out, Pierzynski tagged up at 3rd and tried to score on the throw.
After a collision at home, where Pierzynski knocked Barrett from his feet, Pierzynski slapped home plate with his hand.
After getting up, Barrett grabbed Pierzynski and punched him in the face.
A bench-clearing brawl ensued, and Pierzynski, Barrett, White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry were ejected.

Later in 1993, while pitching against the White Sox in Chicago, Sele was involved in one of baseball's more memorable brawls.
After two consecutive inside pitches, George Bell charged the mound.
Sele, seeming to have a plan, did not move until Bell was feet from him, about to throw a punch.
At the last second, Sele slipped to his left as Bell threw the punch and the burly Mo Vaughn, having rushed to the mound from first base, crashed into Bell.
Bell flipped backwards in the air, crashing to the ground as both of the benches emptied and the teams made their way to the mound [http://www.jokaroo.com/extremesports/baseball/baseballfight-georgebellaaronsele.html].

Steel eventually formed a tag team with Danny Dominion first known as the L.A. Connection in Windy City Wrestling then the "Hollywood Hardbodies".
Along with Dominion, Steel operated the Steel Domain, a professional wrestling school and minor independent promotion, in Chicago between 1997 and 2001.
Steel also wrestled for the Minnesota-based "St.
Paul Championship Wrestling" promotion and the St. Louis-based promotion "Mississippi Valley Wrestling Alliance".

In early 2003 Steel joined Ring of Honor and reformed the Hatebreed with CM Punk.
On March 22, Punk and Steel faced Punk's enemy Raven and another student of Steel's, Colt Cabana, in a tag match.
Cabana appeared to badly injure himself after botching a moonsault to the outside of the ring, forcing Raven to wrestle the majority of the match single-handedly.
Raven eventually managed to defeat Steel following an Evenflow DDT, but, after the match, Cabana turned on him and aligned himself with his friend, Punk, and his trainer, Steel.
Punk, Cabana and Steel named themselves the "Second City Saints" (as all the stable members were from the "second city", Chicago).

The Second City Saints started a feud with The Prophecy, mostly B.J. Whitmer and Dan Maff.
The rivalry led to a Chicago Street Fight.
The match had many dangerous spots including a Spear through a barbed wire board, a splash from inside the ring to the outside onto Maff on a ladder supported by the guardrails, and a Tombstone Piledriver off the top rope through a table.

Despite his backstage role, Pearce made occasional wrestling appearances in ROH, notably during Caged Collision pay-per-view in Chicago on January 31, 2009, taking the pin in the Steel Cage main event.
He also appeared at the "7th Anniversary Show" in New York, NY on March 21, 2009, losing to Bobby Dempsey in 30 seconds, and at "Eye of the Storm 2" on December 18, 2009 in Manassas, VA, where he teamed with Matt Classic in a loss to The Set.

Pearce's highest level ROH match since Cage of Death also came in a cage against Homicide at "The Chicago Spectacular: Night 2", which Pearce lost.
Pearce had originally challenged Homicide to the first strap match in ROH history, only to have Homicide rebuke it and throw out the cage challenge.
Pearce went on to attack and seemingly cost Homicide his chance at the ROH World Title at "Final Battle 2006" in Homicide's match against Bryan Danielson.
ROH Senior Officials would have nothing of it and restarted the match, which Homicide eventually won.
The feud with Homicide seemingly went to the wayside, as Pearce started interaction with Pelle Primeau and Delirious.

At the end of the episode, it seems that Hawkeye's quest will finally be complete as the ribs are cooked and ready to eat.
However, just as he is about to dig in, wounded are brought to the camp and Hawkeye is foiled.
The episode ends with Hawkeye stammering, as he is being pulled away from the table by Trapper and Col. Blake: "But the ribs...they're right there, and we have them...we called all the way to Chicago...we had to trick Mildred, one rib, a tiny rib, just one little riblet ..."

A few days later the ribs arrive but are stuck at supply.
Hawkeye and Trapper go down to try to negotiate them from a stubborn supply sergeant, who is willing to help once he finds out where they're from (as he lives in Joliet, a Chicago suburb, and is a huge fan of Adam's Ribs).
The supply sergeant offers to release the ribs in exchange for 20 pounds of ribs and a quart of sauce which Hawkeye counters with 10 pounds of ribs and a pint of sauce.
After settling on 12 pounds of ribs and a pint and a half of the barbecue sauce going to the sergeant, Hawkeye and Trapper head back to the 4077th.

A few hours later, Hawkeye and Trapper are brainstorming as to how they're going to get the ribs from Chicago to the 4077th as Adam's Ribs doesn't deliver and Hawkeye called for a pickup order.
An angry Klinger, who was wearing a stole that he prized when he became an unwilling target for Hawkeye's lunch, becomes a beacon of hope as he has an uncle in Chicago.
However, Klinger refuses to help because he won't be able to get his Section 8 discharge papers signed (although both Hawkeye and Trapper are willing, none of the other three officers in the camp would do it as three signatures are required).
Fortunately for Hawkeye, Trapper remembers a woman named Mildred Feeny with whom he had a "three-night stand" years ago and calls her to ask for help.
Mildred comes through for Trapper and Hawkeye and the ribs are on their way to Korea from Chicago's Midway Airport in a box marked "RUSH MEDICAL SUPPLIES."

The aerial cloudscapes painted by Georgia O'Keeffe in the 1960s and 1970s are a special case.
Many of them are not landscapes at all, since they don't show any land.
They depict images of clouds viewed from above, suspended in blue sky, with the land below nowhere to be seen; it is the view of clouds regarded at a downward and sideways angle, as from the window of an airplane.
These paintings depict a kind of "pseudo-horizon," formed not where land meets sky but where the suspended layer of clouds—a "pseudo-ground"—meets the empty upper sky.
(See the external link below for an image of O'Keeffe's gigantic 1965 aerial cloudscape entitled "Sky Above Clouds IV", housed at the Art Institute of Chicago).

The flight flew from Chicago to Springfield, Illinois uneventfully, but when it touched down at Springfield Airport, the flight had been delayed by 45 minutes.
At 20:20 local time, the aircraft took off from Springfield.
Roughly 1.5 minutes after takeoff, the crew reported a 'slight electrical problem' and would keep air traffic control 'advised'.
Twelve minutes after takeoff,  the first officer reported to the captain that the left generator was 'totally dead' and that the right generator was producing voltage but wouldn't stay on the line.
Roughly 20 minutes after takeoff, the crew shut off excess lights in the cabin, and meanwhile the voltage of the right generator kept on falling.
The first officer then mistakenly isolated the right generator and the radio contact was lost a few minutes later.
At 20:52, the captain decided to descend to 2400 feet, from there the aircraft slowly descended into a hilly pasture area.
The crew may have attempted a forced landing before the aircraft crashed, or a disoriented pilot mistook strip lighting at a mine for approach lights at Carbondale Airport.
All ten on board perished.

When confronted by Captain Demerest, Guerrero briefly considers giving the attache containing the bomb until a male passenger yells out to a passenger exiting the lavatory that Guerrero has a bomb.
Guerrero, holding the case close to him, runs into the lavatory at the rear of the aircraft and triggers the bomb.
The detonation blows a hole in the wall of the lavatory and Guerrero with it.
Chief Stewardess Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), who is having an affair with the married Demerest and is pregnant with Demerest's child, is injured in the explosion and subsequent rapid decompression.
With all airports east of Chicago unusable due to bad weather, the plane returns to Lincoln International for an emergency landing, even though another airliner stuck in snow has closed the primary runway.
TWA (Trans World Airlines, an actual airline of the time) chief mechanic at Lincoln, Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) is enlisted by Bakersfeld to lead the efforts to move the stuck aircraft, another Boeing 707, even though it belongs to a different airline, TGA (Trans Global Airlines, a fictional airline and the parent company of the film's "Golden Argosy" jet)  Patroni, who is "taxi-qualified" on Boeing 707s, is trying to move the stuck aircraft in time for Demerest's damaged aircraft to land.
By exceeding the Boeing 707 flight manual's engine operating parameters, Patroni frees the stuck jet, allowing Lincoln International's primary runway to be reopened just in time to permit the crippled "Golden Argosy" to land.

Hostak would have two bouts in 1944 while stationed in Houston, Texas, scoring a pair of knockouts.
He would make his post-war return in June 1946 and would win four more bouts by knockout over modest opposition.
Hostak would take on his first significant opponent in January 1947, when he faced longtime middleweight contender Steve Belloise in Houston.
He would knock Belloise down in the 1st round, but was eventually knocked out himself in the 4th round.
After a 5th-round TKO over Anton Raadik in Chicago, Hostak would avenge his loss to Belloise by winning a decision in Seattle in August 1947.
With the win, the 31-year old Hostak again earned a rating as a middleweight contender.

After another hand injury induced layoff, Hostak returned in February 1941 with a knockout win in Chicago, followed up by two more knockouts in April and May in Seattle, before returning to Chicago to face Zale in a third fight on May 28, 1941.
Hostak opened fast, knocking Zale down, though he was up before a count could be administered.
In the 2nd round, Zale pounded Hostak to the body, dropping him eight times, before he was finally counted out at 2:32 of the round.
In November, Hostak would make his first and only appearance at Madison Square Garden, against former middleweight champion Ken Overlin.
Overlin easily outboxed a befuddled Hostak, who threw very few punches on his way to losing a lopsided decision.

After an October 1939 non-title knockout over Charley Coates, Hostak signed for his first bout ever outside of the state of Washington, facing German-Jewish refugee Erich Seelig in Cleveland on December 11, 1939.
Seelig though was no match for Hostak, who knocked him out in 1:21 of the 1st round.
In January 1940, Hostak would take a non-title match in Chicago against middleweight contender Tony Zale at Chicago Stadium.
Hostak would knock Zale down in the 1st round, howeverr Hostak would break his hand in the 5th round, as Zale swept the last five rounds, to take a unanimous decision.

Melgard's most notable performance came during a boxing match at Chicago Stadium during the 1940s.
As the story (fact mixed with some fiction) goes, the fight ended with an extremely unpopular decision.
The capacity crowd became unruly and a riot on the floor broke out with folding chairs flying.
Melgard supposedly tried to calm the uproar with a religious song and then the Star-Spangled Banner.
When that didn't work, Melgard opened up most of the 800-plus stops on the huge Barton organ, floored the volume pedal and laid his hands flat on the middle keyboards.
The resulting sound blew out many of the lights over the arena floor.
Stunned, the fans stopped fighting, picked up their hats and coats, and exited the building.

In January , Spohrer tried his hand at boxing, losing in four rounds by technical knockout to Chicago White Sox player Art Shires at the Boston Garden.
Ironically, the two players became roommates when Shires joined the Braves in 1932.

He returned to ROH along with Chris Sabin on March 30, 2007, following the Briscoe Brothers winning the ROH World Tag Team Championship.
The two challenged Jay Briscoe for a shot at the title on April 28 in Chicago, then attacked him after he accepted.
The two would ultimately lose the match and leave the company.

On July 19, 1989, Haynes became famous for his role in the events during a DC-10 flight headed to Chicago, Illinois from Denver, Colorado.
With Haynes as captain, the airliner suffered damage to its number two (center) engine which caused all three of its hydraulic control systems to fail—an unprecedented problem that made the aircraft nearly impossible to fly or land.
Captain Haynes, first officer Record, flight engineer Dvorak, and Fitch (who had been a passenger on the flight but came forward to offer his help) figured out how to gain some control of the plane.
They were eventually able to get the severely disabled airliner to the Sioux City, Iowa airport, where they crash-landed.
A portion of the fuselage ended up in an adjoining corn field.
Although there were 112 fatalities, a remarkable 185 people survived the crash

Danger is heavily involved with the running of Chicago based female independent circuit independent professional wrestling promotion Shimmer Women Athletes.
She co-runs the promotion along with Dave Prazak, as well as being an active wrestler and color commentator for the DVDs.
Her notable feuds in Shimmer have been against Rebecca Knox, Cindy Rogers, and Portia Perez.

Flight 1572 was en route from Chicago O'Hare to Hartford's Bradley International Airport on November 12, 1995.
The flight departed O'Hare over 90 minutes late due to bad weather and delayed connecting passengers.
En route the flight received an ACARS printout for the weather at Hartford.
It noted an altimeter setting (atmospheric pressure) of , adding that pressure was falling rapidly in the area.
Before making their final approach the pilots were further advised of a wind shear warning and severe thunderstorms for Hartford.
Winds were now out of 170° at  gusting to .
The First Officer checked the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) automated weather broadcast for Hartford which reported an altimeter setting of .
For reasons unknown he entered this as  on the altimeter causing it to read approximately  high.
The Captain checked the weather radar before beginning the non-precision approach to runway 15.
It showed no convective cells on the aircraft's path and he turned it off.
As Flight 1572 began its final approach the crew was advised that the control tower was closing temporarily due to severe weather buckling a window inside the cab.
The tower supervisor remained behind to assist the flight.
The Captain noticed the autopilot was having difficulty maintaining altitude and heading in the buffeting winds.
Five miles from the airport the aircraft encountered heavy rain and some turbulence.
The flight continued descending to , the minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the approach.
This was likely  due to the incorrect altimeter setting.
As the crew began to look for the airport the aircraft continued descending.

"American Airlines Flight 191" was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles International Airport.
On May 25, 1979, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 operating the flight crashed moments after takeoff from Chicago.
All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, along with two people on the ground.
Until the September 11 attacks, it was the deadliest air disaster in the history of the United States.
It remains the deadliest aviation accident to occur on U.S. soil, as well as the second deadliest involving a DC-10, after Turkish Airlines Flight 981.
When it occurred, it was also the third worst aviation disaster in history, and is currently the tenth worst.

Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air, Anaximenes then used his theory to devise a scheme explaining the origins and nature of the earth as well as of the surrounding celestial bodies.
Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air.
In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars.
While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion.Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield.
“Anaximenes of Miletus.”
The Presocratic Philosophers.
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.
152-153.
The moon and sun are likewise considered to be flat and floating on streams of air, and when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant; the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth is likened by Anaximenes to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.Fairbanks, Arthur.

20.

Anaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well.
Earthquakes he asserted were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of overabundance thereof, which also causes cracks in the earth because of the excess of water.
In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks and hills collapse, causing earthquakes.
Lightning is also caused by a violent separation, this time of clouds by winds to create a bright, fire-like flash.
Rainbows are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun.Fairbanks, Arthur.

18;20-21.
These examples further show how Anaximenes like the other Milesians looked for the broader picture in nature, seeking unifying causes for diversely occurring events rather than treating each one on a case-by-case basis or attributing them to gods or a personified nature.

"Andrzej Fonfara" (born November 4, 1987 in Radom) is a Polish professional boxer currently living in Chicago (IL, USA).
He is current WBC youth light heavyweight World Champion.
On May 20, 2011, he scored a massive sixth-round knockout over Anthony Russell (16-3-1, 5 KOs) in the main event of Windy City Fight Night 17 at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago.
With the victory, Fonfara won the vacant WBO NABO title in front of a large crowd of Polish fans including former heavyweight contender Andrew Golota.

Poffo started wrestling in 1948 at Karl Pojello's gym in Illinois.
His first match was in 1949 against Ruffy Silverstein.
He sometimes wrestled as The Masked Miser and managed other wrestlers as the Miser.
He became a villainous character for the first time in 1950.
In the mid-1950s, Bronco Lubich acted as his manager.
He won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship "(Chicago version)" in 1958.

Bush fires, forest fires, and mine fires are generally started by lightning, but also by human negligence or arson.
They can burn thousands of square kilometers.
If a fire intensifies enough to produce its own winds and "weather", it will form into a firestorm.
A good example of a mine fire is the one near Centralia, Pennsylvania.
Started in 1962, it ruined the town and continues to burn today.
Some of the biggest city-related fires are The Great Chicago Fire, The Peshtigo Fire (both of 1871) and the Great Fire of London in 1666.

On October 31, 1947, he had his most famous fight, with future middleweight champion Marcel Cerdan, in Chicago.
Cerdan was far ahead on points going into the tenth round, but then Raadik floored him three times and came close to stopping him, only to lose the decision.
Raadik boxed until 1952, winning some fights and losing more often than he won.
He fought such highly regarded opponents as Carl (Bobo) Olson, Robert Villemain, Steve Belloise, and Harry (Kid) Matthews, but his greatest opportunity was in the past.

In 1963, the Capitol (CWC) promotion may have left the NWA when it was renamed the "World Wide Wrestling Federation".
WWE history lists a tournament final to crown the first WWWF World Heavyweight Champion as Buddy Rogers over Rocca on April 29, 1963 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but this tournament is fictitious.
Rogers had legitimately held the NWA world's title but lost that title to Lou Thesz in Toronto earlier in 1963 in a match—and rematch—ignored by the New York City and Chicago promoters.

On April 26, the most productive storm affected portions of eastern Illinois just southeast of Chicago and portions of northern and central Indiana.
Shortly before 11:00 PM, an F4 tornado through a mobile home park and a subdivision north of Lafayette killing three and injuring 70 others across Tippecanoe County.
The mobile home park was very heavily damaged with numerous structures being totally demolished.
A factory where one of the fatalities was also heavily damaged while the two other fatalities were inside the same home.
Another tornado earlier in the day caused extensive damage to the town of Gainesville, Texas and injuring eight people.
Several other tornadoes were reported in and around the Gainesville tornado at the same time the parent storm tore through most of the city.
Across North Texas near the Red River Valley, over 20 tornadoes were confirmed along that area alone on April 26 from roughly near Wichita Falls to west of Texarkana, Arkansas.
Activity ended on April 27 with weaker tornadoes across Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee and minimal damage reported.

"Atmospheric conditions required to form tornadoes on a small scale."
The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, had issued only a forecast for general thunderstorms at the time of the tornado, with a "See Text" message for isolated severe weather.
Neither large-scale models nor local soundings by the Chicago office could predict the ultimately small-scale event that caused six supercellular storms to spawn 14 tornadoes.

Prior to this event, all of the weather forecasts for the region originated in Chicago.
After the failure to provide an accurate forecast for this blizzard, forecasting responsibilities were expanded to include 24-hour coverage and more forecasting offices were created, yielding more accurate local forecasts.

In December 1929, Shires tried his hand at boxing, taking 21 seconds to knockout an unknown fighter named Dan Daly.
Shires entered the arena wearing a robe with the words "Arthur The Great Shires" printed on back.
It was reported on December 14 that Chicago Cubs player Hack Wilson signed a contract to meet Shires in the ring in January.
On December 18, Shires' boxing career suffered a setback when he lost a bout to Chicago Bears football player George Trafton.
Seeing no benefit in fighting a defeated boxer, Wilson backed out of his proposed bout with Shires.
In late December, Shires was suspended by the Michigan State Boxing Commission and the National Boxing Association after his boxing manager was alleged to have offered money to a future Shires opponent to lose a fight on purpose.
Soon after that revelation, Dan Daly admitted to the Illinois State Boxing Commission that he too had lost his fight to Shires on purpose.
Shires was eventually cleared from any wrongdoing by the boxing commissions after no evidence was found that he had fixed the fights.

Williams became professional in 1989 and fell short in his first shot at a major championship title, a 1994 split-decision loss to Orlin Norris for the World Boxing Association Cruiserweight Title.
Williams was knocked out in the third round in a rematch with Norris later that year.
It was not until 1998 that Williams got another shot at a title belt, a 1998 bout with Imamu Mayfield for the International Boxing Federation Cruiserweight Title.
Williams lost the belt in his first defense to cruiserweight phenom Vassiliy Jirov in a seventh-round knockout.
Williams has since become more of a journeyman than a contender, and has lost in bouts against O'Neil Bell and Kelvin Davis.
His current record is 47-17-1 with 30 KO's.
In 2010, Williams defeated unbeaten Valente Tinajero (8-0, 4 KO's), beating him clearly on points, on the Holyfield-Botha Undercard.
In December 2010, Williams, 46, lost a ten round decision to Carl Davis for the vacant USBO Cruiserweight title in Chicago, Illinois, in perhaps his last major bout.

Over 1,550 trees in Chicago have been cut down and destroyed to eradicate ALB from Chicago.
In New York, over 6000 infested trees resulted in the removal of over 18,000 trees; New Jersey's infestation of over 700 trees lead to the removal and destruction of almost 23,000 trees, Infested trees continue to be discovered.
28,000 trees have been removed in Worcester, MA because of the nearly 20,000 trees confirmed to be infested with the Asian longhorned beetle.
The December 12, 2008 ice storm likely resulted in significant moving of infested downed limbs because of frantic homeowners clearing debris within the infestation following the devastating ice storm.
This has complicated the eradication effort.
A Worcester exterminator has had a beetle in his collection since 1997, and USDA APHIS PPQ has confirmed his finding, meaning the beetle has been in Worcester for at least 13 years, giving it a very long time to move about, especially since vehicles were often parked under infested trees, giving the beetles an opportunity to drop onto cars and be transported elsewhere.

On December 17 in Edison, New Jersey at "Final Battle 2005", Aries teamed with Strong to defeat Sal Rinauro and Tony Mamaluke for the ROH World Tag Team Championship.
The two would then disband Generation Next on June 3, 2006.
In a first time ever match, Aries took on Pro Wrestling Noah star and former GHC Jr. Heavyweight champion KENTA in Chicago on June 24, but was defeated following KENTA's "Go 2 Sleep".

From there, he joined Ring of Honor.
Aries made his ROH main show debut at "ROH: Reborn Stage 2" in Chicago Ridge, Illinois on April 24, 2004.
Aries was unsuccessful, however, losing a four corner survival match also involving Jimmy Rave, Rocky Romero, and the winner, Nigel McGuinness.
Aries was scheduled to return at the May 22 show, Generation Next, to compete in a one night series which would showcase young, upcoming ROH talent.
Alex Shelley, however, hand-picked Aries, along with Roderick Strong and Jack Evans, as members of a new stable (also meant to promote young, upcoming ROH talent) who, instead of earning their spots, would simply take them.
The group took the name Generation Next as their own.

On November 8, 2009, Hamada made her debut under her full name for Chicago based all female wrestling promotion Shimmer Women Athletes, defeating Mercedes Martinez in a match taped for "Volume 27" and losing to Sara Del Rey in a match taped for "Volume 28".
On February 5, 2010, Shimmer announced that Hamada would be returning to the company on April 11 for the tapings of Volumes 31 and 32.
On "Volume 31" she defeated Daizee Haze and on "Volume 32" she was defeated in the main event by Cheerleader Melissa.
Hamada returned to Shimmer on September 11, 2010, defeating Tomoka Nakagawa in a match taped for "Volume 33".
Later that day on "Volume 34" she was defeated by Jessie McKay in a three–way match, which also included Sara Del Rey.
The following day Hamada defeated Shimmer Tag Team Champion Nicole Matthews on "Volume 35" and then took part in an elimination tag team match on "Volume 36", where she, Ayumi Kurihara, Cheerleader Melissa and Serena Deeb defeated Daizee Haze, Madison Eagles, Sara Del Rey and Tomoka Nakagawa.
On March 26, 2011, Hamada took part in the tapings of Volumes 37 and 38, during which she defeated Jessie McKay and Ayumi Kurihara, respectively, in singles matches.
The following day, after pinning Shimmer Champion Madison Eagles on "Volume 39" in a tag team match, where she teamed with Cheerleader Melissa and Eagles with Sara Del Rey, Hamada was granted a shot at the Shimmer Championship.
Later that day, at the tapings of "Volume 40", Hamada was unsuccessful in her attempt to win the title.

Whitmer suffered an ankle injury at the hands of Jacobs at Chicago Ridge, Illinois and was out of action, but appeared at "ROH Survival of the Fittest 2006" to attack Jacobs during his tag match with Colt Cabana against Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli.
Whitmer then began stalking Jacobs at the next few shows.

On April 30, 1911, embers from a hayshed near the Kenduskeag Stream ignited nearby buildings, sparking the Great Fire of 1911.
The fire would destroy most of the downtown area, forever changing the face of the city, but as after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, Bangor rose again and prospered.
Most of the present downtown is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Great Fire of 1911 Historic District, while the portion that survived the fire is the 'West Market Square Historic District'.

The tear drop, also called a runner or a floater, is usually performed by undersized players (mainly point guards).
A player usually starts the layup procedure a good distance away from the basket.
The ball is generally released earlier and in a higher arc than the normal layup.
The ball should be away before the taller defender has the chance to block it.
The purpose of this shooting move is to make the defender miss blocking the ball as the ball is released from the hand one moment sooner than expected.
It is so-named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arc like a falling tear drop.
Gary Payton of the Seattle SuperSonics and John Stockton of the Utah Jazz during their primes, the former in the mid-to-late 90s and the latter in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best tear drops in the game.
Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs frequently uses the tear drop with great success.
Antawn Jamison of the Cleveland Cavaliers has one of the most highly effective tear drop shots in the league despite being a power forward.
Ben Gordon of the Detroit Pistons, Juan Carlos Navarro of FC Barcelona, Steve Nash of the Los Angeles Lakers, Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers, Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics, J.J. Barea from the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Derrick Rose from the Chicago Bulls are currently known for the tear drop move.
