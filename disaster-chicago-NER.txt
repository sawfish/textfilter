  before the   Fire, this was the greatest fire yet seen in an  city.	
It started in a boat house on Commercial Street, likely caused by a firecracker or a cigar ash.	
The fire spread to a lumber yard and on to a sugar house, then spread across the city, eventually burning out on   in the city's east end.	
Only  people died in the fire but  were made homeless and  buildings were burned to the ground.	
This included the federal Exchange Building by which was replaced with the custom house.	
Soon after the fire, poet    described his old home town: "Desolation!

Just before the noon , severe thunderstorms began forming  west of downtown .	
The  storm started to spawn killer tornadoes in  and then Kane Counties starting at 12:00 pm.	
Roughly    a violent F4 tornado tore through Will and Cook Counties cutting a path  long in the  and  areas that would kill  people as the storm devastated the community of Melrose Park.

This  twister was a harbinger of things to come as the morning went on and the atmosphere began to destabilize, due to the abundance of sunshine that preceded the cold front in the warm sector, which covered the lower Great Lakes region extending southward well  the   .	

Weather forecasters and the public alike in the , ,  , , South Bend, and  areas were unaware that the stage was set that  for a tragic tornado outbreak that would follow on a balmy and seemingly tranquil Palm Sun afternoon.	
The weather maps in use in  showed a rather large and deep cyclone over northern  that was forecast to move across central Lower  by nightfall with a trailing cold front.	
Meteorologists knew rain showers and perhaps a thundershower was a good possibility, but were unaware that the helicity, lifted index, and upper level winds were being guided by a strong jet stream with a probable negative-tilt that would create favorable conditions for the development of tornadoes.	

As the Palm  storms swept quickly out of the  area across  , they moved towards 's  .

Although the official paid attendance was recorded as , newspaper accounts reported that only  actually attended, as the game was played in a heavy rainstorm on a cold afternoon.	
The rain turned the field into a "sea of mud" with an inch of standing water on top of the mud.	
In the "  ",   (who also served as the game's referee) compared the field to a "bog" and added:"In my   of football I have never seen worse conditions.	
Pools of water stood on parts of the field and in some places the players' feet sunk into the field  or  inches.	
It rained throughout the game and a strong wind from the north gave the team defending that goal a decided advantage."	
The conditions on the field were so poor that the schools' marching bands declined the usual halftime parade across the field and instead played from the cinder path around the field.	

 , head  the  fice  the      described the damage: "Our investigation convinced me that the tragedy resulted from an explosion somewhere in the region  the baggage compartment in the rear  the plane.	
Everything in front of the compartment was blown forward, everything behind blown backward, and things at the side outward."	
He also noted: "The gasoline tanks, instead of being blown out, were crushed in, showing there was no explosion in them."

The nursing home was equipped with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the   .	
The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated.	
The manual fire alarm system consisted of  pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and  fire alarm box located at the entrance of the building.	
The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the  floor, both stairways and in the storage closet.	
The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors.	
On the  floor,  fire extinguishers and  public address loud speakers were installed.	

The " Wincrest Nursing Home fire" took place on     in  .	
The fire occurred when an arsonist set a wardrobe closet on fire at the    building, located at  N. Winthrop Avenue.	
The alarm sounded at 11:30 a.m. and the fire was put out at 1:30 p.m.
Although the building itself sustained minor smoke, fire and water damage,  people died from smoke inhalation.	
A    housekeeper was arrested by authorities and was charged with multiple counts of arson.	

The fire was put out at 1:28 p.m. CDT.	
The room where the fire broke out was completely gutted and the adjacent corridor sustained only moderate smoke and heat damage.	
 other rooms also suffered heat and smoke damage.	
No smoke damage was evident on the  or  floors and water damage was minor.	
However despite the minor damage to the building,  fatalities were reported due to smoke inhalation.	
An investigation made by the    and fire department.	
The survivors claimed that the fire was started in a plywood wardrobe closet in   which was unoccupied at the time.	
Although the actual cause  the fire was unknown, the     arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts  arson.	
It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the fire was an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the fire were never noted.	

At the time of the fire, the building was occupied by  residents,  nurses,  aides and  office, kitchen and maintenance staff.	
 of the residents were in the chapel room on the  floor of the building.	
Fire was reported in room  by a nurse’s aide who pulled the fire alarm box.	
The alarm was received by the    at 11:43 A.M (CDT).	
Attempts to put out the fire by staff proved to no avail.	
The  fire engine arrived at the scene of the fire   and    as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building.	
More fire engines arrived   as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building.	
At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the  floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs.	
The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals.	

The "  Loop derailment" occurred on    when a    elevated train rear-ended another on the northeast corner of the Loop at   and   during the evening rush .	
The collision forced the   cars of the rear train off the elevated tracks, killing  people and injuring over  as the cars fell onto the street below.	
It remains the single worst accident in the agency's history.	

According to the  ,   had "the worst record in the nation" for issuing warnings for severe storms, only issuing warnings 24% of the time when a warning was justifiable.	
Even , many meteorologists refer to the " Syndrome" as the idea that it's better to issue too many warnings and be wrong than to miss  critical warning, as was the case for the  Tornado.	
At some point after the  tornado, the    reduced the  office's workload by creating an office in ,  and allowing offices in the Quad Cities,  , , ,  and ,  to issue forecasts for their respective areas.	

The "  tornado" was a devastating tornado that occurred on the afternoon of    .	
The violent tornado killed  people and injured .	
It is the only F5 tornado ever recorded in  and the only F5 tornado to ever strike the  area.	
There are few known videos or photographs of the tornado.	

Conditions were ripe for severe thunderstorm development, and with both low level and high level steering winds from the west-northwest, the      issued a  Thunderstorm Watch for northern  valid 1:30 p.m. through 8:00 p.m. CDT that night.	
The  predicted a derecho-type event for later that night as rapidly developing thunderstorms along a cold front in  would be carried by the steering flow into the  area.	
 of these storms developed supercellular characteristics south of , steering  to  degrees to the right of prevailing steering winds.	
By , mid-level steering winds had begun to veer, causing a wind profile slightly more favorable for tornadic development.	
This helped develop a high precipitation supercell.	

In   following  tornado,   Wear  was heavily criticized for providing no warning of  approaching tornado.	
The  Disaster Survey Report was highly critical of the forecast process within the  office as well as coordination with local spotter networks and the preparedness of these groups.	
Prior to , the    in  was responsible for providing forecasts for the entire state of .	

As the  office was overwhelmed with its workload, no warnings were issued by the office until 2:32 p.m. &mdash;    after the  tornado was sighted southeast of .	
  severe thunderstorm warning was issued almost     3:23 p.m., but this provided no indicion th a tornado was on the ground d did not mention the area where the tornado had tracked.	
No tornado warning was issued until after the tornado lifted.	

In eastern ,    shattered many of    snowfall records.

The "  heat wave" was a heat wave which led to approximately  heat-related deaths in  over a period of  .	
 , author of the  book "Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in ", has noted that in the  , the loss of human life in hot spells in  exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.	
The heat wave heavily impacted the wider Midwestern region, with additional deaths in both  ,  and , , as well.	

The temperatures soared to record highs in  with the hottest weather occurring from   to  .	
The high of  on   was the  warmest  temperature (warmest being  set on   ) since records began at     in .	
Nighttime low temperatures were unusually high; in the upper 70s and lower  F (about  C)&mdash;as well.	
Record humidity levels also accompanied the hot weather.	
The heat index reached  at  airport, and  at  .	

Impacts in the  urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than .	
Urban heat islands are caused by  concentration of buildings and pavement in urban areas, which tend to absorb more heat in   and radiate less heat at night into ir immediate surroundings than comparable rural sites.	
Therefore, built-up areas get hotter and stay hotter.	

Other aggravating factors were inadequate warnings, power failures, inadequate ambulance service and hospital facilities, and lack of preparation.	
City officials did not release a heat emergency warning until    of  heat wave.	
Thus, such emergency measures as 's  cooling centers were not fully utilized.	
The medical system of  was severely taxed as thousands were taken to local hospitals with heat-related problems.	

Another powerful factor in the heat wave was that a temperature inversion grew over the city, and air stagnated in this situation.	
Pollutants and humidity were confined to ground level, and the air was becalmed and devoid of wind.	
Without wind to stir the air, temperatures grew even hotter than could be expected with just an urban heat island, and without wind there was truly no relief.	
Without any way to relieve the heat, even the inside of homes became ovens, with indoor temperature exceeding  at night.	
This was especially noticeable in areas which experienced frequent power outages.	
At   just north of ,  school students lived in dormitories without air conditioning.	
In order to ease the effects of the heat, some of the students slept at night with water-soaked towels as blankets.	

About  people were on the top wooden balcony at the time of the collapse.	
According to  witness, the sound of splintering wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time.	
The collapse started on the  floor, pulling down other balconies below.	
The , ,   floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately   people among them.	
Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell.	
Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others.	
 of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived.	
The    supplied the main rescue effort.	
 people were killed in the collapse, with  more subsequently dying while hospitalized;  people were injured.	

In , the city of  filed a negligence lawsuit against  of the survivors,   and  .	
The city alleged that the  balcony collapse occurred after defendants Fenton-Hathaway and  "intentionally and negligently" began jumping up and down on the porch.	
's brother,  , was killed in the collapse.	
The charges against Fenton-Hathaway and  were later dropped.	

On    the deadliest porch collapse in   history occurred in .	
An overloaded balcony collapsed during a party in an apartment building, killing  people and seriously injuring  others.	
The ensuing investigation was highly critical of the way the balcony was built, finding a large number of errors in its construction which ultimately resulted in the collapse.	
However, the building's owner continues to blame overcrowding on the balcony for its complete structural failure, although he has taken steps to strengthen the balconies at his properties to prevent a recurrence of the disaster.	
The accident resulted in sweeping inspections of  similar structures across , with  cases being actioned by the city authorities.	

As the evacuating crowd pushed open the doors, several people already climbing the stairs were knocked down and subsequently pinned by the ensuing crush.	
Security attempted to pull them to safety, but the pile rapidly reached  feet in height as a result of more than  simultaneously attempting to escape the chaos inside.	
 , a former E2 guard who had worked at trying to free trapped patrons, recalled to the "Chicago Sun-Times" in   that he had heard other clubbers atop the stairs laughing at the fracas, unaware of the fatalities stemming from the ground-floor pileup.

 , a large futures exchange, stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on   were concerned, its investigation found no evidence that high-frequency trading played a role, and in fact concluded that automated trading had contributed to market stability during the period of the crash.	
Others speculate that an intermarket sweep order may have played a role in triggering the crash.	
#"The fat-finger theory:" "Disproved."	
In the immediate aftermath of the plunge, several reports indicated that the event may have been triggered by a fat-finger trade, an inadvertent large "sell order" for    stock, inciting massive algorithmic trading orders to dump the stock; however, this theory was quickly disproved after it was determined that   's decline occurred after a significant decline in the E-mini SP  Futures contracts.	
The "fat-finger trade" hypothesis was also disproved when it was determined that existing   and ICE safeguards would have prevented such an error.	
, the fat-finger theory is not considered credible.	
#"Impact of High Frequency traders:" "Regulators found HFT's exacerbated price declines."	
As noted above, regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines.	
Regulators determined that high frequency traders sold aggressively to eliminate their positions and withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.	
A   report by the      () an international body  securities regulators concluded that while "algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk their usage was also clearly a contributing factor in the flash crash event    ."	
Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) was the underlying cause of the flash crash.	
 hypothesis based on the analysis of bid-offer data by   is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-offer spread) to exchanges in batches.	
Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.	
However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.	
Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on  .	
On    the regulators probing the crash concluded: "that quote-stuffing – placing and then almost immediately cancelling large numbers of rapid-fire orders to buy or sell stocks – was not a “major factor” in the turmoil."	
Some have put forth the theory  trading actually have been a major factor in minimizing and reversing the flash crash.	
#"Large directional bets:" "Regulators say a large E-Mini   seller set off a chain of events triggering the Flash Crash, but did not identify the firm."	
Earlier, some investigators suggested that a large purchase of put options on the   index by the hedge fund   shortly before the crash may have been among the primary causes.	
Other reports have speculated that the event may have been triggered by a single sale of  E-mini   contracts valued at around $4 billion by the  ,  firm    on the   .	
Others suspect a movement in the  Dollar to   exchange rate.	
#"Changes in market structure:" Some market structure experts speculate that, whatever the underlying causes, equity markets are vulnerable to these sort of events because of decentralization of trading.	
#"Technical glitches:" An analysis of trading on the exchanges during the moments immediately prior to the flash crash reveals technical glitches in the reporting of prices on the  and various ATSs that might have contributed to the drying up of liquidity.	
According to this theory, technical problems at the  led to delays as long as   in  quotes being reported on the Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) with time stamps indicating that the quotes were .	
However, some market participants (those with access to 's own quote reporting system, OpenBook) could see both correct   quotes, as well as the delayed but apparently  CQS quotes.	
At the same time, there were errors in the prices of some stocks ( , , and some ETFs).	
Confused and uncertain about prices, many market participants attempted to drop out of the market by posting stub quotes (very low bids and very high offers) and, at the same time, many high-frequency trading algorithms attempted to exit the market with market orders (which were executed at the stub quotes) leading to a domino effect that resulted in the flash crash plunge.

The aerial cloudscapes painted by   in   and  are a special case.	
Many of them are not landscapes at all, since they don't show any land.	
They depict images of clouds viewed from above, suspended in blue sky, with the land below nowhere to be seen; it is the view of clouds regarded at a downward and sideways angle, as from the window of an airplane.	
These paintings depict a kind of "pseudo-horizon," formed not where land meets sky but where the suspended layer of clouds—a "pseudo-ground"—meets the empty upper sky.

Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air,  then used his theory to devise a scheme explaining the origins and nature of the earth as well as of the surrounding celestial bodies.	
Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air.	
In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky,  proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars.	
While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion.Kirk, ,  , and  .

The moon and sun are likewise considered to be flat and floating on streams of air, and when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant; the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth is likened by  to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.Fairbanks, .

 used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well.	
Earthquakes he asserted were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of overabundance thereof, which also causes cracks in the earth because of the excess of water.	
In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks and hills collapse, causing earthquakes.	
Lightning is also caused by a violent separation, this time of clouds by winds to create a bright, fire-like flash.	
Rainbows are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun.Fairbanks, .
